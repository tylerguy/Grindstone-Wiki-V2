<p>Through comparison with the original image of the doll trees, we find that the silver scratch marks have been added to the image. These scratch marks form the Ogham Alphabet, which is read bottom up. Deciphering the Ogham text gives us MZVK for the left tree, STEGANOGRAPHIA for the middle tree, and LFIHRI for the right tree. (Note: the V in MZVK can be mistaken for other letters like F due to the nature of the Ogham Alphabet. The K can be confused for EA likewise.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steganographia is the name of a book by Johannes Trithemius, who has a cipher called the Trithemius Cipher. By decoding MZVK and LFIHRI using this cipher with shift 0, we get the words MYTH and LEGEND. This, then, leads us to Qibbel, god of myths, legends, and stories, among other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although not confirmed, Qibbel is the most popular and plausible solution to this Mission.</p>
