<p>Similar like the fourth mission of Phase 1, the Phase 2 final mission is an <strong>Researcher and Employee Encyclopedic Efficacy Entrance Exam (REEEE). &nbsp;</strong>The exam was announced on March 11, 2022 via the #administrative-announcements channel on Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
  <h2>infin [any/all]<i> â€” </i>11.03.2022</h2>
  <p>We are pleased to announce that the application process has been fully integrated into the website, including the release of the final mission: The Universal Magical Academy at Dial Researcher and Employee Encyclopedic Efficacy Entrance Exam [REEEEE]! For those of you who have already begun completing the application process via Discord, please do not resubmit completed missions through the website. Your responses have already been recorded for the missions you have completed. If you began your application process via Discord, we recommend completing Missions 1-3 through Discord before taking the REEEEE through the website. If you have not yet submitted any mission responses to <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Desk of Janet</span>, feel free to make all submissions through the website! The applicant-missions channel will remain in place for one week to allow any remaining responses to Missions 1-3 to be submitted via Discord. As a reminder, you do not need to take the REEEEE until you are prepared to end your applicant process and receive placement within the Universal Magical Academy at Dial! Once responses to all four missions have been received from you, your application will begin to be processed. This restricts your ability to earn up to 150 DPC through the Competency Examinations available by request through contacting a member of Infernal Affairs. We encourage you to thoroughly evaluate the opportunities available to you as an applicant before proceeding with your final task submission. <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Applicant</span></p>

<p>Since cooperation is not allowed for this task, Questions and (possible) Answers will be posted later.</p>
