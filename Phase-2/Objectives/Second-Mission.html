<p>The Second Mission of Phase 2 was a a list of numbers, posted on February 04, 2022 and has been updated on February 09, 2022.</p>
<h2>Part 1: The number code</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mission 2</strong></p>
  <p>7:2:4 | 7:4:2 | 1:1:10 | 2:3:13 | 2:4:9 | 2:4:19 | 12:2:6 | 14:15:3 | 2:3:13 | 16:21:12 | 16:21:12 | 16:52:3 | 18:8:14 | 2:3:13 | 12:2:6 | 2:4:19 | 6:8:88 | 2:3:13 | 12:2:6 | 7:2:4 | 2:3:13 | 16:21:12 | 14:2:69 | 12:2:6 | 19:11:729 | 19:11:416 | 12:2:6 | 7:70:68 | 16:52:3 | 7:70:41 | 2:3:13 | 2:4:19 | 12:2:6 | 19:34:17 | 19:42:434</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We assumed a book cipher, but without knowing the book it is almost impossible to solve. Therefore we bought a fist hint, which was a picture of the known tree. Lould see the Disord logo. But even this hint does not lead to an solve.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>On February 24, 2022 we got an new hint.</p>
<blockquote>
  <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:27.28%;"><img src="/hint-prototype.png"></figure>
</blockquote>
<p>The text could be translated to:</p>
<p>I = rules-and-regulations II = administrative-announcements III = processing IV = self roles V = getting-started Middle hex = GENERAL 6 = introductions 7 = general-lounge 8 = general-lounge-2 9 = music-box-recommendations 10 = infernal-affairs-bot-and-meme-chute 11 = promotional</p>
<p>So thw first number of the original missions leads to a discord channel, the second one the respective post and the third one to the letter. This allowed us to finally decode the message:</p>
<p><strong>“Direct Message The Desk of Janet RU”</strong></p>
<p>Sending “RU” to Janet gave us a follow up puzzle</p>
<h2>Part 2: The audio file</h2>
<p>We received an audio file: <a href="/mission_2.mp3">/mission_2.mp3</a></p>
<p>Using the music sheet cipher we got this as decoded message:</p>
<p><strong>“The Ballad of Basi”</strong></p>
<p>Since Basileus is the god of music, it is assumed that “Basileus” is the final correct answer.</p>
