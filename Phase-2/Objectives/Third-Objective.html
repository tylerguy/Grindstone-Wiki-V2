<p>The Third Mission was a “physical” task, posted on March 2, 2022.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mission 3</strong></p>
  <p>Mission 3 requires a physical component on behalf of applicants. You are tasked with taking a series of original photos containing letters or objects with the appearance of letters to spell out the name of a PM-1 god of your choosing. You may not submit photos of letters that you have created or drawn yourself, nor may you take photos of any digital images or letters to satisfy a photo requirement. Each letter must be represented by a separate picture. At least one picture must be taken outdoors. All images will be examined to ensure they are original and taken by the applicant. Acceptable images include photos of letters found within your environment and objects that appear similar to letters, such as a wheel being utilized as an "O," a fence post being utilized as an "I," etc. Submit complete photo galleries to the <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Desk of Janet</span>.</p>
