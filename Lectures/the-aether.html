<h2>Lecture</h2>
<p>We will begin with the obvious, what is the aether? The aether is an amaterial that exists in space 5-dimensionally outside of existing planes and its absence allows for the movement or stretching of the 4th and 5th dimensional space of planes. Over years we have tried to quantify intensity of aether and determine a way of measuring it. Different units exist for the measurement of the intensity of the aether but the smallest relevant measurement given current technology has been described as a singular packet of aether. While a packet is not a practical means of measuring aether it does lend to understanding the theory and properties of the aether. Outside of quantitative anlysis of aether we recognize qualities of aether including the uniqueness of charge. Aether has 3 charge characteristics and each attract, repel, or act inert depending on the relationship with the other.</p>
<p>The aether moves constantly within the aetherial matrix. Some areas with predictable currents while other much more random movement is observed. Part of this is due to the three charges of aether and their interaction. Accumulation is when movement by charge forces a large drift of aether creating something of a wave. Since aether is amaterial you would call it a massless particle as well. Over limitless time one might think the aether would eventually settle and have a regular pattern of push and pull put due to the complexity of overlays, casting, aetherial exhaust, position of planes, and anomalies the movement of the aetherial matrix is very complex. For this reason and the expectations of time dilation it is much easier to summate aether near to your position and account for very large and regular currents of aether. Unfortunately there are times when these are not even reliable to be "mostly right" which any caster hopes for. This is why theories have been developed to determine bad times and positions of casting though most do not have much credibility</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Is the aether stored in a different "place" somehow?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The aether exists within the aetherial matrix. You certainly open up the plane to the aetherial matrix through aeonization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We know diamond disperses Aether, and we know lead absorbs Aether. Can diamond and lead disperse or absorb Aether that doesnâ€™t overlap with it in 3D space? Or does Aether have to </strong><i><strong>overlap</strong></i><strong> with the material to be affected by it in the aforementioned manners?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>As I understand it, it must but lead acts like a sponge as though the aether is almost attracted to it. Something we will elaborate on<br><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
