<h2>Lecture</h2>
<p>We will begin with the obvious, what is the aether?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aether is an amaterial that exists in space 5-dimensionally outside of existing planes and its absence allows for the movement or stretching of the 4th and 5th dimensional space of planes. Over years we have tried to quantify intensity of aether and determine a way of measuring it. Different units exist for the measurement of the intensity of the aether but the smallest relevant measurement given current technology has been described as a singular packet of aether. While a packet is not a practical means of measuring aether it does lend to understanding the theory and properties of the aether. Outside of quantitative anlysis of aether we recognize qualities of aether including the uniqueness of charge. Aether has 3 charge characteristics and each attract, repel, or act inert depending on the relationship with the other.</p>
<p>The aether moves constantly within the aetherial matrix. Some areas with predictable currents while other much more random movement is observed. Part of this is due to the three charges of aether and their interaction. Accumulation is when movement by charge forces a large drift of aether creating something of a wave. Since aether is amaterial you would call it a massless particle as well. Over limitless time one might think the aether would eventually settle and have a regular pattern of push and pull put due to the complexity of overlays, casting, aetherial exhaust, position of planes, and anomalies the movement of the aetherial matrix is very complex. For this reason and the expectations of time dilation it is much easier to summate aether near to your position and account for very large and regular currents of aether. Unfortunately there are times when these are not even reliable to be "mostly right" which any caster hopes for. This is why theories have been developed to determine bad times and positions of casting though most do not have much credibility</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Is the aether stored in a different "place" somehow?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The aether exists within the aetherial matrix. You certainly open up the plane to the aetherial matrix through aeonization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We know diamond disperses Aether, and we know lead absorbs Aether. Can diamond and lead disperse or absorb Aether that doesnâ€™t overlap with it in 3D space? Or does Aether have to </strong><i><strong>overlap</strong></i><strong> with the material to be affected by it in the aforementioned manners?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>As I understand it, it must but lead acts like a sponge as though the aether is almost attracted to it. Something we will elaborate on.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the theoretical limit of what a person be able to do when doing a spell, like Aetherial exhaust?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Technically as long as something can be summated and programmed fast enough spells can continue to be larger or more complex although there are limitations to sapient species and so it is hard to say though ritual casting is limited to 13 participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Urbarra said something about the self mending of the holes one makes for a spell. Can you explain the basic for that? What heals it and what would keep it open without a active involvement of a caster?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Only aeonization at a weak zone such as an active caster would open these holes though some appear naturally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does Aether have a range? Like, does it decay to something after traveling a characteristic distance?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Something that is material would be as you say to have mass characteristics. &nbsp;There is also amaterial, nonmaterial, and immaterial.</li>
  <li>The amaterial is something that mass-less in characteristic. &nbsp;The immaterial is something the suggest towards or approaches meaning it has partial characteristics. &nbsp;The last is nonmaterial which is honestly a cheap way of saying it isn't material and kinda hooky as shit, technical term.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So how would one know how much of the Aether can they influence without injuries, considering that it is constantly in flux? I'm not too sure if influence is the right word for it but I couldn't think of a better one.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When you begin drawing aether early in your career you typically have someone who can assist you with the process starting very, very small so as to not injure yourself. You'll learn quickly your own capabilities for the manipulation and programming of aether. You do get better at it. Those who are aetherial efferent casters will routinely do small tests to determine the ebb and flow of the aetherial matrix in preferred space for casting every morning using very minor summation. The short answer is you try to build up and not overwhelm yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can different locations have aether with slightly differing properties? As in some spots the aether is less turbulent or more, or more malleable, or it resists manipulation?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The limit of how to do it without safety is determined by your ability to summate. As for locations do you mean within the aetherial matrix? If so then absolutely. One of the aforementioned interesting properties of your plane is the turbulent qualities of the aetherial wave patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So the locations could make the programming easier or more difficult right? So optimal locations could be compared to our world's idea of Ley lines and related convergence points</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming remains about the same but the summation especially difficult making the even start of casting dangerous here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it believed that the wave patterns affect the programming </strong><i><strong>and</strong></i><strong> summation?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They do not as far as we know. We believe the alteration to programming is due to location and the interactions of both anomalies and satellite planes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do planes attract or repel each other ? is there like a 5d gravity thing?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Neither, they fill space, kinda.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oh is there such a concept of anti-Aether, similar to what we have of like anti-matter?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm unfortunately no expert on anti-matter though I have read several articles on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is the aether made up of other substances? like how matter itself is made up of quarks? Also does the aether have mass?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not know if Aether can be broken down further. We are limited in our understanding.</li>
</ul>
