<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>Since our lecturer is on leave presently I will be filling in again. &nbsp;Like the previous Alchemy lecture this is a survey in a subspecialty. &nbsp;Today we will be discussing Transmutation: The Intersection of Aetherial Studies and Alchemy. &nbsp;Before we continue to the lecture I would like to revisit a few important concepts and differentiate between them as to avoid possible confusion. &nbsp;Belthidian Laws are those universal laws that are constant in any plane or region of space within the 5 spatial dimensions while Natural Laws describe physical laws observed within space typically within a defined area or plane. &nbsp;Belthidian Laws explain Natural Laws. &nbsp;It is important to remember that existing models in Alchemy are imperfect and often contradict other models but are practical in explaining certain phenomena. &nbsp;Lastly synthesis magic is the youngest school of aetherial casting accepted by UMAD.</p>
<h3>Transmutation</h3>
<p>Transmutation to put it simply is the utilization of aetherial casting, efferent or innate, with concepts of alchemical theory to alter the material of one observed object to act as or become another. &nbsp;It should be recognized that transmutation is not simply limited to turning one thing into another and that having one material act like another is just as, if not more, important to the study and the practical applications of transmutation. &nbsp;Transmutation is also the study that fathered a further separation in aetherial studies into the dedicated school of synthesis magic. &nbsp;Beyond its link from Alchemy to Aetherial Studies transmutation is also important in Infernology, Divination, Theology, and many other studies.</p>
<p>The two most important schools of magic that led to the current studies of transmutation and prior to the development of synthesis were thermokinetics and programming. &nbsp;Some of the first skills one develops in transmutation are the use of thermokinetics to limit physical interactions between materials. &nbsp;This means we might use thermokinetics to create an "aetherial barrier" between an object and another or create a temporary container. &nbsp;This concept for advanced students is later applied to smaller and smaller samples of the material to inhibit or speed up the rate of anticipated reactions. &nbsp;This is also very important if an alchemist intends to create isolates like alchemical kindness or alchemist dust but wants the purity or grade to improve. &nbsp;The process between turning a higher grade from a lower might be very volatile and therefore the reaction must be conducted in a synthetic environment created by this thermokenetic manipulation.</p>
<p>The creation of frames is often important to creating specialized tools for particular reactions of study within transmutation and is why programming is such an important field for the early development of laboratory skills in transmutation. To better develop these aetherial mechanisms for assisted alchemy an individual should also be well equipped with an understanding of multiple studies. It is for this reason transmutation alchemists are typically scholars of advanced alchemical theory and work to discover alchemical constants to better understand the rules and models of alchemy and where they break down. Since "power" as an alchemical concept is typically attributed to contact with aether all experimentation in transmutation assumes a certain degree of artifacts in resulting data. General rules have been created to account for this.</p>
<p>I will pause here to answer questions.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Any questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>hmmmmmmmmmmmmm</p>
  <p>So if i'm understanding correctly</p>
  <p>it's more important for transmutation to affect how things act vs what things are, it's it would be like making something that's not normally flammable flammable? or is it in a more practical sense</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It is a concern of what is does and does not interact with and how it does interact. &nbsp;Reducing volatility by having a power 1 water 2 perhaps acting as a power 2 according to the wheel. &nbsp;This is usually by limiting reactions.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Ahhhh, okay, that makes sense then</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>So if someone wanted to transmutate something it would have a higher chance of success if they have enough understanding of both alchemy and aetherial studies?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Correct. It can be argued that transmutation is one of the most cross-disciplinary sub specialties.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Also, since I saw that it was mentioned, what is alchemical happiness? It sounds like a drug of some kind</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>That was my error, it should be kindness</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>ahh kindess</p>
  <p>Oh it does say kindess</p>
  <p>I just read it way wrong</p>
  <p>whoops</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Alchemical Kindness is isolated alchemical life. &nbsp;It also has certain physiological effects to a number of species but I would not call them euphoric as recreational drugs might be.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I see :thinking:</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p><i>Got it</i></p>
  <p>And regarding this “aetherial barrier”</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It does cause vasodilation and in the event of a number of species the rapid expulsion of certain substances.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Sounds fun</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>Is the barrier enough to provide a synthesized environment to try to improve the grade of a certain material?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald (she/her)</strong></p>
  <p>Is infernology related to infernal affairs?</p>
  <p>Sorry only tangentially related</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>This is a complicated question as it is dependent on the particular reaction. &nbsp;I am no expert but I am familiar with higher grade power reactions mostly out of discourse with a few friends in alchemy. &nbsp;Grade 6 power for instance could react so rapidly in between 6 and 7 when exposed to the air that it degrades back all the way to 4 and combustion might be seen. &nbsp;Multiple tiny barriers are created to maximize the yield from 6 to 7. &nbsp;This means the end product is a combination of heat, air and a variable power, power 4, and power 7.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald (she/her): Is infernology related to infernal affairs?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only through history and the name itself.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald (she/her)</strong></p>
  <p>Could we have an image of the wheel also</p>
  <p>Okay</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I'm sure this could be created.</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: This is a complicated question as it is dependent on the particular reaction. &nbsp;I am no expert but I am familiar with higher grade power reactions mostly out of discourse with a few friends in alchemy. &nbsp;Grade 6 power for instance could react so rapidly in between 6 and 7 when exposed to the air that it degrades back all the way to 4 and combustion might be seen. &nbsp;Multiple tiny barriers are created to maximize the yield from 6 to 7. &nbsp;This means the end product is a combination of heat, air and a variable power, power 4, and power 7.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understood</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>A reminder that these first few lectures are to give a survey understanding of various topics before further specialization can happen. &nbsp;As you progress in your careers it should also help you form questions for researchers you work with.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>A particularly rough facsimile of a Victorian label.</p>

  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The wheel is also very important in Iatrochemistry for diagnostic reasons.</p>
  <p><strong>Forward_Horizon [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe I’m misunderstanding, but you mentioned that transmutation does not only apply to changing an item into a different one. Does that mean an item can be fully changed into a separate item in addition to changing certain characteristics or does changing certain characteristics cause the item to change completely?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Transmutation can involve the changing of one material into another but the observation that it can refer to changing how one material interacts with another temporarily is more important.</p>
  <p><strong>Forward_Horizon [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>How different is the process of changing one material into another from the process of changing how materials interact with each other?</p>
  <p>Also, is it possible to change how items interact with each other permanently or is that even a desired result?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Typically it involves the separation or the limited contact of a material when it would otherwise but it can also involve the increased or decreased rate of reaction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Forward_Horizon [He/Him]: Also, is it possible to change how items interact with each other permanently or is that even a desired result?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is theoretically possible but would be done through advanced small frame programming.</p>
  <p>Though I wouldn't know the practical applications of this.</p>
  <p>Perhaps some artistic ideas that immediately come to mind.</p>
  <p>Any further questions at this time?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>none for me!</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I'll continue with the lecture then.</p>

<h3>Transmutation</h3>
<p>One of the greatest struggles of transmutation is that as an alchemical discipline it often involves consideration of the natural laws of a singular plane, PM-1. &nbsp;There are some constants that are observed for the most part in other planes typically including reaction rates. &nbsp;Transmutation specialists when working as a field researcher on another plane often begin their study looking for familiar constants and then expanding from there. &nbsp;This is typically done by using well studied materials, isolates, or by conducting rate experiments. &nbsp;Some of the most common experiments for early data collection involve the alteration of certain metals and the rate of change observed.</p>
<p>Transmutation specialists also assist in understanding extraplanar materials and how they might relate to PM-1 materials. For instance, many materials of EXT-918 hold similar characteristics to materials of PM-1 that have similar names. Transmutation specialists are also very important for rate reduction when considering defense research. In short Transmutation specialists are highly interdisciplinary theorists whose study aims to create the previously unobtainable to better understand the laws that the universe is governed by and our relation to each other but they can also change the expected presence and function of metals and raw materials.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>This concludes my survey in transmutation. For advanced principles of transmutation you'll need to wait until after we conclude our survey series in Alchemy.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Final questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>Some</p>
  <p><strong>Forward_Horizon [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>What are some examples of observed constants?</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>How would you gauge the rate of change in a material?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Foxj1917: How would you gauge the rate of change in a material?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How long it takes for the majority of one material to become another in a reaction depending on the quantity of both materials that are interacting with one another. &nbsp;Not too dissimilar to how you observe it.</p>
  <p>We recognize a property conservation no matter what plane we are on. &nbsp;The observed conserved properties might vary. &nbsp;I could possibly have Gillie's mentor join and expound on this. &nbsp;They are a transmutation specialist.</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>Are the natural laws in EXT-918 similar to ones in PM-1? If so is the process of transmutation also similar?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As I understand it there are several similarities in natural laws. I'm not certain about how similar they are for transmutation but I believe your department will be assisting with data at some point to help determine that.</p>
  <p>Questions will be open for the next 40 minutes</p>
  <p><strong>Foxj1917</strong></p>
  <p>I’ve used enough brain power for today</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>kind of not related but also kind of it; are the "Schools of Magic" specific to Aetherial, despite being utilized in every other department? something like "Schools of Magic of Aetherial", or saying "the schools of magic fall under the aetherial department if i were to explain it to someone else?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Are those considered Aetherial specialities, and then subspecialties fall under those?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>I don't believe so? My understanding is that the "schools" of magic are their distinct categories, with specific design and function and ways of working. But they are utilized by not just many of our departments, but people all over the world.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>School are not the same as specialties but are unique to Aetherial casting.</p>
  <p>Not simply aetherial studies.</p>
  <p><strong>Forward_Horizon [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>What are some known examples of constants?</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>hmm okay. I think specific to UMAD is the understanding I need. would love to understand the world one day, but for now will have to start small :sweat_smile: Thank you Researcher Wyatt and Blaise :blessup:</p>
