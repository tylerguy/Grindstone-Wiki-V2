<h3>Pre-Lecture Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>So i'm new but i can seem to find the basics or Aether 101. So what is the basics of Aether? is it part of once own body and performing a ritual to exude it into a preffable shape? Or do i gather it from the air or a relic or component? what is general components (verbal, somatic and/or materials) and order of use? Do material component come from aether creatures or from aether infused relics? is this the same for every plane? i know those are many but just choose one is fine</p>
  <p><strong>Tyler [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>To start I'd recommend looking at this page on the wiki <a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Departments/aetherial-studies"><u>https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Departments/aetherial-studies</u></a> as well as the ask-elham thread under aetherial's interdepartmental</p>
  <p>To answer the first question tho, my understanding is that&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“Aetherial casting usually happens when the user draws upon the aetherial matrix, using a four point and an aeonized object but can often involve other components.”</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>also “Aether - the material that fills the region of the universe beyond the terrestrial sphere”, just for further breakdown :UwU:</p>
  <p>||almost as complicated as planar :ugh:||</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>So it's dark matter?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Not quite, dark matter is remarkably inert.</p>
  <p>Aether is quite the opposite, I feel.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>I wonder how many physicists across the globe reflexively winced at that question</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>mediocre: also “Aether - the material that fills the region of the universe beyond the terrestrial sphere”, just for further breakdown :UwU:</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It can be simplified as to “the stuff that is in between planes” but that does cut out a lot of stuff xD</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues: I wonder how many physicists across the globe reflexively winced at that question</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We all exist in a hive mind.</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: So i'm new but i can seem to find the basics or Aether 101. So what is the basics of Aether? is it part of once own body and performing a ritual to exude it into a preffable shape? Or do i gather it from the air or a relic or component? what is general components (verbal, somatic and/or materials) and order of use? Do material component come from aether creatures or from aether infused relics? is this the same for every plane? i know those are many but just choose one is fine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>i believe aether exists in the aetherial matrix, which is basically what all planes exist within. casting, like tyler said, i think can be compared to opening a “hole” in the aetherial matrix [which usually requires a four point or aeonized object] and then using summation to draw or manipulate aether out of the hole</p>
  <p>correct me if im wrong</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Yeah, everything that is said above is basically my understanding too. I think some of the technical details haven't been elaborated on, or are just ridiculously complex.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Like tapping a big keg.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>And making pants.</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>yeah thats a very non-scientific description but its the easiest way for me to understand it</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Using the power of math. In most cases.</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>and then programming would be using the aether once it’s been drawn out?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I have no idea how programming works ;-;</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>yeah im not sure how it works on a technical level</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>But yeah it just turns the aether you've drawn out into a spell.</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>i just know the basics of it is the aether is utilized in some way</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Into the spell's effects I should say.</p>
  <p><strong>infin [any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>^^ that description makes sense to me</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>so if I where to use dnd terms to make myself understand.. the aether matrix is the plane where all planes exist in (like the astral Sea) but it consists of aether which looks like the weave ( at tapistry of magical essence unsee-able with the naked eye, making up every thing there is making it look like kirbie yarn world) you use spells by pulling these aether threads, bending space and time in that specific place into utility of your choose?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: So i'm new but i can seem to find the basics or Aether 101. So what is the basics of Aether? is it part of once own body and performing a ritual to exude it into a preffable shape? Or do i gather it from the air or a relic or component? what is general components (verbal, somatic and/or materials) and order of use? Do material component come from aether creatures or from aether infused relics? is this the same for every plane? i know those are many but just choose one is fine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I assume by your first question "So what is the basics of Aether?" you further elaborate on this with the following questions otherwise I'm not exactly certain where to start. Charge types? The math behind common motion? What is special motion versus common motion? How does Aether become programmed? How do we utilize and manipulate? The latter is a large question to chew on as well.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The aether must be programmed to take on the effective shape as you call it that is desired. It is not part of the body and typically we reserve the term ritual casting for the type of large scale casting that requires a foci and multiple people in part because it retained the name from an antiquated understanding of aetherial efferent casting. The entire process requires aeonization which is much like poking a hole, summation which is the manipulation of wave patterns in the aetherial matrix to control the rate and size as well as direct the aether to the point of aeonization, and lastly programming which is the process of changing the aether to the desired spell cast.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The aether comes from the Aetherial Matrix, a place of 5 dimensional space that contains all planes. These planes exhibit 5 dimensional characteristics but their placement in the matric is often described in a fluid motion of space across 4th and 5th dimensional coordinates. It is easiest to understand it through two combined models which are a disk and the hourglass model. I believe name attempted to represent these models for ease in the past.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Components for aetherial casting beyond the created program or written spell are usually material to make the spell simpler. For the healing school the use of various foodstuffs is common. Somatic components were more common in older casting styles and are less and less prevalent, although relevant to certain spells, now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Relics assume they are the remains of something. I'm not certain what you mean but a 4-point and aeonized object are necessary for the current model of casting.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is not true for every plane and is why we distinguish natural laws from Belthidian laws. Understanding why the natural laws differ from plane to plane is ultimately the goal of Planar Studies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: so if I where to use dnd terms to make myself understand.. the aether matrix is the plane where all planes exist in (like the astral Sea) but it consists of aether which looks like the weave ( at tapistry of magical essence unsee-able with the naked eye, making up every thing there is making it look like kirbie yarn world) you use spells by pulling these aether threads, bending space and time in that specific place into utility of your choose?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I like to think of it more like cloud with currents and the manipulation of the current natural movements allow for us to direct the aether to points of aeonization, holes artificially created. &nbsp;When found in most planes it moves rapidly away from itself violently unless quickly programmed. &nbsp;That is why the rate of the aether moving into the plane which the caster is on is very important. &nbsp;If the caster cannot program fast enough it can be dangerous.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So this touches upon a question I was thinking of reserving for later, but, so the Aetherial Matrix is indeed 5D, Aether fills a 5D volume, but planes only have two degrees of freedom (freely varying coordinates), the 4th and 5th dimensions?</p>
  <p>Because in my drawings, I was interpreting the surface of the hourglass as 5D, and planes could move in any of these five dimensions, or could freely move anywhere, in any direction, in the Aetherial matrix.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>To put it simply yes, they have 5 dimensional movement technically. For the simplicity of casting it is easier to express 2 dimensions of space for purposes of summation. The minutia of the other dimensions of movement are often studied in Planar Studies and are beyond the scope of lectures I will be presenting. Once we have a new Planar Studies lecturer this can be further elaborated on. If you wish however you can attempt to speak to James as he is a bit more informed on Planar Studies than myself given his current research.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh, oh okay so there is movement in all 5 dimensions, just that 2 take precedence, so hopefully I won't have to completely revise my math and drawings lmao.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unless I do have to do that.</p>

<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>I would like to begin tonight's lecture by first returning to our previous lecture in series to complete it. &nbsp;Following this lecture Aetherial Studies has three other lectures that I may or may not be part of. &nbsp;After this I am not qualified to continue speaking on the subjects and further survey information will be provided by experts.</p>
<p>I also have taken note that many of you have an interest in the mechanics of aetherial efferent casting but I would like to remind you the history of the subject is also important. For those who want future more in-depth lectures on history it will be an option to you. We will however be returning primarily to subjects outside the history of casting for all future aetherial studies lectures.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I see there are questions so I will treat this time before lecture as a continuation of questions from the previous lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>when i reffered to relics i used it in the broadest of terms. because im unsure of the meaning. does it need to be organic but aether born like Unicorn horn or a phoenix feather. maybe organic like said food a ham sandwihich made with love for a spouse. or can it be non-organic. but those it need to be mythical? like just a store bought sowing needle or the needle of a devoted Worldwar 1 hospic or even excaliber?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh, do you perhaps mean aeonized objects? I think they're like, objects that allow interface with the Aetherial Matrix, to put it broadly.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Based on the assignment relating to them, it did seem like it could be anything, but that objects with an obvious point (for directionality) were preferred.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>You could consider an aeonized object any mundane thing that has been "aeonized."</p>
  <p>Another way to think of it is it's radioactive - in a way that does not appear to be harmful to people, but allows for it to interact with the aether and serve as a tool for casting.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: when i reffered to relics i used it in the broadest of terms. because im unsure of the meaning. does it need to be organic but aether born like Unicorn horn or a phoenix feather. maybe organic like said food a ham sandwihich made with love for a spouse. or can it be non-organic. but those it need to be mythical? like just a store bought sowing needle or the needle of a devoted Worldwar 1 hospic or even excaliber?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Much of the time Aetherial Efferent Casting requires components that are accessible. Those who create spells typically wish for casting to be accessible or even cheap. This is not always the case but yes, if a material component were fats found in ham, it would simply require you but ham.</p>
  <p>The consumed components are like this but there is still a need for the four point and object.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Could be a glass bottle. Could be a chair leg. Could be old bones, or a rock, or a sword's hilt. Whatever the thing is - it has become "aeonized" and serves as an aeonized object.</p>
  <p>It can't be lead, is really the major limitation.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>How do components work in casting? Are they “used up” or aeonized?</p>
  <p>Or something else?</p>
  <p>I know they’re different from aeonized objects but I don’t know how</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are types of casting that call for very specialized components but these are typically not aetherial efferent.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kaydo: How do components work in casting? Are they “used up” or aeonized?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They may or may not be consumed for the purpose of the casting. &nbsp;It widely depends on what is cast. &nbsp;The component has a direct purpose, perhaps it is consumed in that it was a fat that become like a slick grease for you. &nbsp;In this case you could say it was turned into the final product.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: They may or may not be consumed for the purpose of the casting. &nbsp;It widely depends on what is cast. &nbsp;The component has a direct purpose, perhaps it is consumed in that it was a fat that become like a slick grease for you. &nbsp;In this case you could say it was turned into the final product.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I see. This reminds me of chemical reactions on our plane, where the substance may be used up, changed entirely, completely dizzolved, etc. is this a fair comparison?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any spells where a component is required but doesn't seem to fulfill any obvious function when the spell is cast?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>That is fair but some components aren't "consumed" they just are necessary.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Got it</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So a reagent with Aether, the latter is procured using the aeonized object?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: Are there any spells where a component is required but doesn't seem to fulfill any obvious function when the spell is cast?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Are we speaking strictly of aetherial efferent casting or all kinds of casting?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Mainly the first I guess, but also knowing in general would be interesting.</p>
  <p>From your earlier description it sounded like the component was either used/transformed (like the fat into grease) or had some other direct purpose (I assume if the component is being enchanted or something with programming), so I wondered about spells were this was not the case.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There have been spells that have required components that have not been immediately obvious to why they were necessary. There is a lot of research that has gone into spells like this with the goal to determine why. Much insight has been gained this way and often the spells of this nature are created out of error.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Cool!</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>so the aeonized object work like a modem like the wire in a lightbulb letting aether through creating the spell (light) and breaks when max resistandce is surpassed</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Imagine the plane like an eggshell except it does not have uniform hardness to it. The weak point of the shell is present in space near the 4-point while the object acts like a very, very fine needle. Although it is fine it struggles to break the eggshell usually but could forcefully do so if necessary while the weak point allows it to slide in with ease. The hole is created and the flow of aether through the cross sectional hole is regulated. In EXT-918 you call the flow of something be it water, air, anything at all across a cross sectional area over time flux.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: Cool!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A great example to accidental interactions being further studied and revealing mysteries in EXT-918 was Alexander Flemming being careless story that was shared with me.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>So, do 4-point objects create weak points just by existing or are there extra steps because otherwise the general presence of a 4-point object seems like it could be dangerous. Also, if multiple 4-point objects are gathered in the same location does this have any additional effects?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p>This does have certain effects in addition to many people casting in the same general space. This was briefly mentioned before if I recall. There actually will be a lecture on safety in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I was thinking this might be encroaching on "future lecture topic" territory.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>also the comparisons of aether to water and air. hints to the existance to aether Erosion. and using spell advances the decay.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Anyway, I think I'm done with questions for now as otherwise I'll just keep drifting further away from the topic of tonight's lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>yeah im :sweat_smile: sorry too</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>No need to apologize. I extended my stay tonight just in case. Also you might find one of the future lectures interesting and on point in a way with that statement Blizzard.</p>
  <p>I'll note this and forward it to Aetherial Studies.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: also the comparisons of aether to water and air. hints to the existance to aether Erosion. and using spell advances the decay.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is a really cool point that I don't think I would have thought of. Glad you did!</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I will resume the lecture now.</p>

<h3>Completion of Discovery Casting</h3>
<p>While programming existed in some form prior the efforts of Tor's oldest student accelerated the study with the assistance of the last Azalt Emperor. This student, now known as Desolice, began their early work creating "invisible security instruments" for the Emperor and their ever increasing paranoia before they accidented upon a discovery that would set into motion their life's work. Long script thermokinetics could be created for inanimate objects but in seeing this Desolice realized that the inanimate could mean more than wood or stone but also flesh. Desolice was a polymath and a young physician at the beginning of their work with Tor and attempted to emulate the works of divine by giving motility to dead flesh. It was previously through large script thermokinetics but soon he realized the impracticality of complex systems utilizing thermokinetic spells as their means of motility and so combined with his understanding of medicine and his fascination with consciousness developed the first, and very primitive aetherial undead. Unlike undead today they would very often have limited simulated consciousness, if it could be called that, and they did not often have full control over their bodies. It was however a start. The Mouth of Citzi however is what gave him recognition as the father of Necromancy which ultimately led to further development in construct creation through programming. Through the motion captured in his creations he was given the title Enchanter by the Azalt Emperor.</p>
<p>Desolice's creations however spurred concerns by many members of the cloth. The future was uncertain and the seeds of distrust began to be planted but it would not be until the fall of the Azalt that they would flourish and the Order of the Magus would step in and take control of the distribution of information regarding aetherial casting.</p>
<p>I will take questions now.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I will take questions now. Next we will discuss the dark ages and how the discovery era of casting would come to an end.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>What is "The Mouth of Citzi"? Or was this covered in a previous necromancy lecture?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>What are long/large script thermokinetics? Does it just mean thermokinetic spells with a high degree of intricacy?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: What is "The Mouth of Citzi"? Or was this covered in a previous necromancy lecture?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Mouth of Citzi was a creation of fine motor necromancy. The deceased Citzi Meliani's head was animated and could even create noises though it was not attached to any torso. Fairly unremarkable by the standards of necromancy now but it was incredible back then.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>kind of reads like a military strategy of using enemy bodies to create zombie suicide bomber. w</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: What are long/large script thermokinetics? Does it just mean thermokinetic spells with a high degree of intricacy?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Long and Large script are used interchangeably and refer to the very large and "structures" similar to frames prior to the current spell programming page.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: kind of reads like a military strategy of using enemy bodies to create zombie suicide bomber. w</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Flash Necromancy Shock Bombing.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>You said "Desolice's creations however spurred concerns by many members of the cloth" Was this due to the usual ideas of concerns related to the existence of the soul or desecration of bodies?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Unfortunately has been utilized before. We will not be discussing this however.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: You said "Desolice's creations however spurred concerns by many members of the cloth" Was this due to the usual ideas of concerns related to the existence of the soul or desecration of bodies?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is something to theorize but I believe it was because the people of the cloth were already losing much control to the ever dominating political machine of the Azalt Empire that even invaded their own temple structures from time to time. &nbsp;They lost a lot and did not want to yield any more power by being shown the aetherial can do what those of the cloth though was only within their own abilities through their gods.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>also muscle control is activated by ionised calcium. i presume we are now talking about the first use of aeonised Calcium to control the dead</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Interesting connection blizzard</p>
  <p>Didn’t think of that</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe a sort of early galvanization, using existing nerve pathways to use some sort of bioelectric stimulation to force movement?</p>
  <p><s>Can atoms be aeonized? Could directionality be related to their quantum spin? Off topic but fun thing to contemplate.</s></p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Pauchik would be the best to explain as he is an accomplished programmer and necromancer but to my understanding it relies on similar ideas as aetherial mechanisms where frames in of themselves cast. Transmutation Alchemy and Iatrochemistry have been popular studies alongside Necromancy which is why the ultiziation of synthesis casting has been important in future full frame and undead designs.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>on the more historic topic, after the fall of a kingdom or Era many piece of knowlegde will undoubtly lost through the lack of generations to pass it onto or new age propoganda. with what we know of the Order of Magus, what would be a good estimate percentile of lost knowledge in regards to the topic at hand?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As you might be familiar a Dark Age or Era is a time of decline, a period of loss instead of gain for information. A lot was lost during the fall of the Azalt but even beyond that the Order of the Magus has been historically a very secretively organization. There are accounts, though they would be denied more often than not, as to the destruction of objects and records of historical importance by their order during such a period to impress upon the people more authority through propaganda that could not be challenged. Some of course would claim this is absurd as many people today are not lettered let alone then. Now the Order of the Magus has much less of a bite and current law permitted to practice their ways but they are a very different creature still today. It cannot be known what has been lost however nor what has not been shared with us but here at the Universal Magical Academy at Dial we strive to better understand our world and the Belthidian Laws for the safety and betterment of it.</p>
  <p>Any other questions before I finish part two of the lecture series and move on to part three?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I have one. I tried to look it up, but was foiled by discord's lack of an exact search. What does "lettered" mean?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Pauchik also informed me that there ill be a future lecture on advanced Iatrochemistry reviewing something called aetherial grafts. This will further explain the Toristic Study behind how muscle moves in aetherial undead.</p>
  <p>Lettered means to know how to read.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Ah. Thanks.</p>
  <p>I'm done for now. Especially since questions about the low levels of literacy (our term for being lettered) in your plane would definitely be a question for cultural studies.</p>

<h3>Completion of Discovery Casting</h3>
<p>During the time after the fall of the Azalt fear spread and was utilized by many to consolidate power. The Order of the Magus began the systematic destruction of reminders of the Azalt to further their separation from them and to inspire new hopeful ideologies within the faiths outside of what they saw as universally Lay'Oran and antithetical to their Belthidian belief system. This structure which for a long time stood as a religious neutral entity acting in ways to impress ideologies on the world in hopes to, in their words, return us to a sense of security. They acted swiftly and almost altogether monopolized the teachings of aetherial casting. They would make agreements with future Monarchs across Homeland that they should continue to control this dangerous study citing it was what resulted in one of the greatest nations in history. There were issues however in utilizing aetherial casting effectively when it required continued use of large lots of land and instruments to cast. In a time with so much suspicion it had become increasingly important to be able to present or conceal you were a aetherial caster as well.</p>
<p>Caeso who at the time was the youngest Red Cloak, a position of authority in the Order of the Magus, stood atop one of the famed towers in what is now the blightlands and it is rumored he looked upon the remnants of one such land where casting was easier while writing lecture notes and was struck with inspiration. "If the point we open to the aether is so small then why do we need so a big place?" He took what looked so small at a distance, four triangles of a substance of minor alchemical power, and suggested they be positioned on a stone tablet with corners of high alchemical power. To his excitement it created a small space for ease of casting. His concept developed and in time, after he achieved status of Arch Magus, created a system of utilizing charged objects and books with these four points. This was the beginning of the Classical Era of Aetherial Efferent Casting.</p>
<p>I will take questions now.</p>

  <p>So i get that a organisation as the Order Magus which roughly translates to groep of high tier casters would wanna horde power and using the fall of a magocracy to get magic away from the masses to make their power seem more grand compared to commoners. but what i don't get is that when they were halfway they decided to change the route to a religious privilege. surrendering their power over to a church.which only makes sense if they were pawns of the church all along or their upper rings have a hidden agenda of ascending themself into godhood</p>

  </ul>
  <p>I have very much condensed the history of the Order of the Magus but simply put, as you might see in an earlier lecture on education, they were themselves an Order which is itself a religious organization. &nbsp;They were established in the hopes of being apolitical but of course nothing is and in time they found with the powers that be for certain rights and authorities. &nbsp;Their gain and loss of status as well as secularity versus religious order was most prominent in two major events in history and much dictated by their internal politics as well as the political atmosphere of whichever time we might be talking about.</p>
  <p>You might be able to request a more detailed overview of their history from an expert in Culture in the future.</p>
  <p>Any further questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>nope</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I will move onto the final lecture in series. Please note that at the end of the next hour I will need to stop but I still encourage questions. We will likely need one more night to finish this series up.</p>

<h3>Classical Casting</h3>
<p>The Classical Era of Aetherial Efferent Casting is very similar to the current process of New Mastery. An aeonized object and four-point are utilized with advanced instructions and often pre-programmed spell aids are utilized in the four-point. The Classical Era lasted up until Enchanter Laster Thorpe of Parne conceived of the three steps to casting and theories of charge for the aether describing the aether as not one fluid substance but a wild slurry of three charged packets.</p>
<p>Before Enchanter Thorpe and after Caeso there was a time of innovation and cunning. While full systems of spells could not easily be printed most of a spell was present during the Classical Era. These partitioned spells were unpoetically named Chunk Spells which had gaps and required advance knowledge still in mathematics and current theory to parse together the chunks. Expert casters would often try to event new chunks or try to close the gap between current existing chunks but vital information and patterns had yet to be discovered. While theory and Toristic Process were strong during this era it became an assumption there were some objects that were superior to others for casting and particular shapes were the most important. This led to something called a pointer. Chunk casters were often very slow at casting but their casting safer and more specific as they also utilized very small aeonized areas. The chunk and pointer casters soon became called Wenders for how slow they were which is where we derive the word wand from. The Wender caster casts from the Wand.</p>
<p>Wenders took their object very seriously and due to the limitations on casters would often make them a noticeable feature for themselves. After the settlement of the North Eastern Kingdom and its growth leading to the exile of what are now colloquial called Mountainfolk the political game involving aetherial efferent casters did not end. Due to the need for secrecy more practical objects became popular for both criminal casters and the Order of the Magus. While Wenders were dying out Chunks became bigger and bigger. Aeonization and Programming became more well understood but the research of new spells was a tiresome process often taking very long periods of intense concentration because it was never certain what the patterns might look like at a given moment. This led to critical analysis of aetherial wave patterns across large area from the Order of the Magus. The data collected over decades would have been a waste if not for an agreement between early Westerners and a less than spiritual Red Cloak. The leak of information however combined with the spiritual advise of tontured Arch Clerics led Lord Magnus Beaufort, a mathematician and man of nobility of the time, to surmise general rules for the study of the aetherial matrix and its wave patterns.</p>
<p>I will be taking questions.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Any questions so far?</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>I first assume enchanter was a title gained by performing a specific act. like Dwayne the decapitator because he beheads people. so i assume Desolice the Enchanter, but now i see Enchanter referred to as a rank within the order of magus just like red cloak rank. did the order of magus use Desolice title out of respect or to spite the Azalt empire?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So were these chunk spells partitioned due to just, the difficulty of printing out a full complete spell? Did people just have difficulty recording the whole thing? Or is there something else more complicated?</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>So server events are open thought experiments of wenders whom are trying to fill the gaps of chunks with theoratical experiments?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>

  </ul>
  <p>The title Enchanter is used to describe a polymath and master theorists who adds to their study in a cross-disciplinary manner. &nbsp;Much how Doctor means "One who is learned" Enchanter is an uncommon title.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: So were these chunk spells partitioned due to just, the difficulty of printing out a full complete spell? Did people just have difficulty recording the whole thing? Or is there something else more complicated?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many shortcuts in spell casting had yet to be developed and only after Magnus Beaufort did we begin to create advanced rules of summation necessary for the summation process. &nbsp;For the most part Chunking was necessary due only a grasp on two of the now three step casting.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>And the gaps involved in chunking is just due to the difficulty of grasping those two steps?</p>
  <p>So it was a gap in reasoning for the spells, moreso?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: So server events are open thought experiments of wenders whom are trying to fill the gaps of chunks with theoratical experiments?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm not sure I understand. &nbsp;We currently teach all personnel our studies and about PM-1's understanding of the world while we have applicants also assist in some basic data collection. &nbsp;Those who are assistants may propose theory but more often than not will aid in more advance data collection and toristic practices prior to their work as Researchers where they will often compete to have their project funded for research.</p>

  <p>Precisely.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: So it was a gap in reasoning for the spells, moreso?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>lost in translation, defiled through yeasr of propaganda, just lost though the ages after the fall of the Azalt empire. probably</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: I'm not sure I understand. &nbsp;We currently teach all personnel our studies and about PM-1's understanding of the world while we have applicants also assist in some basic data collection. &nbsp;Those who are assistants may propose theory but more often than not will aid in more advance data collection and toristic practices prior to their work as Researchers where they will often compete to have their project funded for research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>yeah but they act the same as who you discribed wenders</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Wenders were from a previous era of casting though.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The ability to cast did eventually speed up as summation began to be utilized.</p>
  <p>Instead of pointers and chunks we use for spell pages and any aeonized object plus the three step organization of casting.</p>
  <p>Is there any further questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>if mountainfolk still exist does that mean wenders also still exist under a different name?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I suppose anyone who uses the old chunking method and does not utilize summation could still be called a Wender.</p>
  <p>Mountainfolk are however a people while Wenders are practitioners of an old type of aetherial efferent casting.</p>
  <p>Any other questions before I proceed?</p>
  <p>I will continue then.</p>
  <p><strong>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</strong></p>
  <p>ah yes, the strawberrie -&gt; fruit scenerio</p>

<h3>New Mastery</h3>
<p>Beaufort's work eventually led to a better understanding of not only aetherial wave patterns and the common types but also our understanding of how to utilize summation to control the rate and flow of aether to aeonized points in space thus rapidly increasing the rate of casting. This led to the end of Wenders and Wands. Though New Mastery is young it does have some history however. From the separation and establishment of the casting schools, to the discovery of synthesis, the advancement of programming to efficiently create full frames, and even the eventual loss of the monopoly over aetherial casting by the Order of the Magus first slowly in the West and then the end of it suddenly in Belthas after the revolution.</p>
<p>New Mastery is not a century old but with it has come a host of new spells with ease of access as well as aggressive development of contingency magic. The contingent single caster while not common has become increasingly accessible for those with the money to spend. Now even those with limited understanding of aetherial casting might be able to make a little magic. Tools continue to become smaller and smaller but also more complicated year after year.</p>
<h3>Closing Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>With limited time I will be taking questions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard: ah yes, the strawberrie -&gt; fruit scenerio</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm not certain I understand what you mean.</p>
  <p>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</p>
  <p>strawberrie is a fruit but a fruit not necessarily a strawbarrie. wnders are mountain folk but mountainfolk aint necessarily wenders</p>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>Contraposition I think is the term.</p>
  <p>ArcaneIllumination</p>
  <p>Our plane has an observational "law" known as Moore's Law that was originally about a specific measurement and form of computational power but has been extended to be more general that roughly states that computational power roughly doubles every two years. From your description it sounds like something similar has been happening within the field of aetheric casting. Is this an accurate comparison and has this phenomenon been named or noted?</p>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>I don't think it is a rough equivalent but I suppose that would be hard to determine. I do not think the term has a name either. Perhaps once you find yourself a researcher your work might provide such an idea proven by trends you record to be named.</p>
  <p>ArcaneIllumination</p>
  <p>It just seems from your description that especially since the New Mastery era the rate of discoveries and advances seems to fit an exponential growth curve as opposed to a linear growth curve.</p>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>I have another meeting in only a few minutes but I will leave questions open. Otherwise I believe I can conclude this series.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: It just seems from your description that especially since the New Mastery era the rate of discoveries and advances seems to fit an exponential growth curve as opposed to a linear growth curve.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I would say it is certainly accelerating.</p>
  <p>It is an exciting time.</p>
  <p>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</p>
  <p>So in summary</p>
  <p>In the Azalt era casters made leaps in programming leading to the invention of necromancy&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The order of magus took the fall of the Azalt empire as a change to monopolize magic almost making it exstinct.</p>
  <p>Lone wolfs inside the order rediscover uses and theories of magic use. They use a way to archive and use their findings. Spells with gaps were named chunks spells.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rogue casters researcher gaps and became wenders&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Order of magus tried to monopolise magic again by making the wenders exstinct&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Outsider dr. Beaufort uses wender theories to make a system for magic&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All leading to a guide from magic based on Azalt programming, order of magus lone wolf’s step by step rules for aether gathering and use, wender requirement and gap research and a mathematician connecting it al land creating a basic concept of the aether matrix.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Making the order of magus more and more redundant.</p>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>I believe there have been a few misunderstandings but I'm happy to clear this up. I will unfortunately have to come back to this later.</p>
  <p>Fire Wizard in a Blizzard</p>
  <p>take all the time you need. i can wait.a as i have vacation:grin:</p>
