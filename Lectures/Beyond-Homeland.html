<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p>Thank you all for coming to my lecture. I will be filling in for Bruno. For those simply reading this later I hope you still find it insightful. Today I will be discussing basic geography of what many people in Northern Belthas colloquially refer to as Homeland. Please note that this large land mass is not the only one known of within our world.</p>
<h3>Homeland</h3>
<p>Belthas is one of the largest countries within this continent located on the east coast. The land Belthas occupies is separated into several "belts" describing basic geographic characteristics but beyond this there are several large regions that were once ruled over by the noble class prior to the dissolution of the old systems of government. We will however leave the discussion of the regions for a later date and focus on the belts prior to moving to other countries.</p>
<p>The Southern most areas of Belthas occupy a tropical region which is where much of our sugar crop is grown. To the far South East a peninsula projects and cuffs slightly upward. It is on this cuff Seawell, a city some of you might be familiar with, is located. A chain of islands finds itself here but there are three major islands off to the North of this area. Moving West in the tropical region however a boarder is made by the Blightlands that is maintained by defensive forces on the side of Belthas mostly established by a combination of boarder patrol stationed there from the Belthean government and those stationed by various religious orders. This boarder expands to one of our great lakes and eventually into a belt known as the grain belt.</p>
<p>The grain belt is where much of our foodstuffs come from as well as a small region within it dedicated to much of our honey and mead production. To the East is the Black Marsh before eventually connecting with the Ocean and to the right is a boarder that partly is created by the Northern Blightlands and part by the mountains and Oudstian Boarder.</p>
<p>It is within this Belt and continuing into the Wetland Belt, a place most comparable to coastal North Western Europe in your world, that three more of our great lakes can be found and off the coast to the East the first few major Belthean Islands.</p>
<p>The Wetlands are generally referred to as such because of the rainfall found in much of this region. It is the wetlands where the Belthean Capital can be found as well as the metropolis of Paint and the defensive metropolis Dragon's Den. Dial is further north in a region more comparable to Northern United States or Southern Canada. This region is much more hilly and much cooler than the wetlands. It should be noted that there are nearly 700 recognized "major" settlements within the continent with countless other smaller farming communities and that places like Dial and Paint are given special mention due to their impact on our nation and others as epicenters of trade, defense, or culture.</p>
<p>Another major peninsula can be found in the far North East of Belthas that also hooks northward. This is the edge of non-contested territory for us as to the North West we enter a bitter cold region that ends at a boarder contested by the Northern Nations. A conglomeration of micronations and others that their recognition is often in question by some of the more established countries of our world. None the less, it is not part of Belthas and the boarder respected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dowan Clownin</strong></p>
  <p>Can we have a list of all 700 major settlements. In alphabetical order.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>That would take some time to compile in that order but it can be provided quickly. The list of course as stated prior would not be a complete list just a general list of major settlements.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any available maps for Belthas?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are maps, the most accurate are approved as such by us when it comes to Belthas. Unfortunately until you are admitted I cannot share a map of our country.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>Is there anything interesting in the Black Marsh?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are a number of settlements. It's also said that somewhere there is the final resting place of Acerbus, a necromancer from the 2nd age of aetherial magic.</p>
  <p><strong>actualdanascully</strong></p>
  <p>i'm very interested in the northern nations</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>We will be expanding a bit on the geography of the North.</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>How many continent's are there and how many countries are there?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's not certain. It's impossible for us to travel far from the West Coast and we only made contact across the waters to the East very recently.</p>
  <p>We also have the Horn of Plenty in Black Marsh</p>
  <p><strong>Nevaeh Mau</strong></p>
  <p>"Horn of Plenty"? That sounds pretty.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>IT's very much not. It's a prison compound, a large one.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>Has every bit of your world been explored and cartographed? Or are there unknowns?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, in recent history one of the most notable was a group called The Company Paint. Prior to the revolution Monty Graves, a Duke at the time, commissioned a small group from Paint to do as such.</p>
  <p><strong>actualdanascully</strong></p>
  <p>why is it impossible to travel east? is it because of the border?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's not impossible to travel East however there is a large divide between our continent and the one to the East of us not too unlike your Americas and Europe. The West however has a moving, violent, large, and eternal storm.</p>
  <p><strong>Samjens</strong></p>
  <p>Is it known how accurate the maps are?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Our technology that accounts for the accuracy of our maps is not too dissimilar to something slightly better than your 17th century cartography tools.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>Aside from honey and mead what's the production in the grain belt?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Most major grains, quite a lot of low floating yeasty beers, near the South of it some of our liquor production. Other plants for textiles and cash crops. The tropics are where most of our tobacco comes from but nothing quite as good as what comes out of the blightlands.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>There's no livestock?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Wooley livestock mostly is raised a little further North but yes there is plenty of livestock there.</p>
  <p><strong>Nevaeh Mau</strong></p>
  <p>I wonder, which part of your map hasn't been charted?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There is a place called no-man's land which no country has an agreed claim to. It's nestled in a very arid place between the Northern Blightlands and the Mountains.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>There are many kinds of grains tho</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Rye, Barley, Oats, something similar to your corn...</p>
  <p><strong>actualdanascully</strong></p>
  <p>why is it named the blightlands?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There is a large and invasive carpet mycology in the area that is parasitic to some plantlife.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>Do you make ca√±a out of the sugar? (It's a sugar cane alcohol)</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The town of Rumshore makes various kinds including those from grain sugar or molasses.</p>
  <p><strong>Nevaeh Mau</strong></p>
  <p>Where is a good place to find coffee or where the beans are sold?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Southern Belthas, specifically the South West has the best coffee in the country. If you can get it imported however is seems that the South Central Blighlands have the best.</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>If you have more time afterwards can I hear more about the blightlands and how and why it exists and has a carpet of mycology?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Carpet flora is common all over your world as well. You favor grasses and ivy typically. This carpet mycology has religious roots however. It was believed that Khazhak was responsible for it when he was asked to shoot Kadmin out of the sky as a challenge by Au'Pak.</p>
  <p>Any other questions? Would you like to hear about more specific geographic characteristics of Belthas, for me to start on Oudste, for me to start on the Blightlands, or for me to start on the North?</p>
  <p>Very well, I'll continue to discussing the North.</p>

<h3>The North and the West</h3>
<p>To the North of Belthas and covering the Northern edge of the continent is a collection of various nations and micronations. Given it's massive size we generally just call it "The North". To the North East of Belthas there is a place known as the eye, a weird of woodland surrounded by a large clearing. This is a bitter cold place and much of the surrounding area leading all the way to the boarder of Belthas is occupied by the Red Orcs, green skinned Orcs with a xenophobic disposition who are highly territorial. While it is uncommon for a culture or nation to be a single species these people are unique. Many attempts at contact have ended poorly and they have regularly aggressed upon the Belthian Boarder. Much of what we know about them comes from contact with their neighbors. Somewhere slightly North West of Belthas lies one of only a few major cities in the North where the higher governing body to many city states, mobile nations, and complex trade networks resides. The predominant faiths of the region are Junt and Au'Pak.</p>
<p>While trade can be conducted by the loop 3 of the four seasons in the year few from Belthas or Victoria attempt trade directly through the North due to various dangers including weather, terrain, the natural fauna, and the poorly understood peoples that inhabit the land. The Liath are native to the region, Gillie Mason who you have met is one such person. The Liath people live a very difficult life contending with the inhospitable nature of the North and even go without naming their children for many years until they are certain they will survive. Even with the bitter cold in the north there are two regions of what are called the bridge islands that are navigated through for the loop, the west being two and east being three such islands, that are south of what seems to be a sheet of white with hard winds and little vegetation. This large landmass is approximately half the the size of the nation of Oudste.</p>
<p>Further West is a place dominated by the Northen Rau and most nations, not currently including Belthas, have accepted it as an independent nation. The ability to govern some of the people on the outskirts of the established boarders however has led many to be hesitant to accept it as such yet. One such major city is a cultural and academic epicenter known is Obelus who does not claim to be governed by the coastal metropolis that is the capital named Okios of this North West nation.</p>
<p>Currently between one of the North West great lakes and the mountains lies a profitable region for the fur trade. This is a place currently seeing blood shed as Victoria engages in skirmishes during what we collectively call the fur war.</p>
<p>There are many other regions to cover and so we will need a future continuation of this lecture.</p>
<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I'm ending the lecture and accepting questions as we will need more time to continue to expand on the other regions. Once you have a general sense of the geography I'd like to discuss unique geography such as weirds, Rameus' Fault, and other such things.</p>
  <p><strong>Lastsume</strong></p>
  <p>Any red orc that might've left on their own and went south or to any other city?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>There are certainly those who have left the region but often they are killed by others out of fear. Red Orcs do travel, they do leave. IT's just difficult to see one outside of the geographic region they are often tied to.</p>
  <p><strong>Nat | HELLION</strong></p>
  <p>What are the most common ways of travel in general between countries and continents if any? Especially considering the harsh climates in The North i'm very interested.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>That might be more of a question for Bruno or Gillie but generally mass caravan is done for trade in Belthas. If you have the money you can hop on a ship and travel by the loop however.</p>
  <p><strong>Nat | HELLION</strong></p>
  <p>Is there anything that The North has that other places do not in materials, minerals or anything they trade/export from their landmass to others?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps mostly from the Northwest but yet again I'm not expert on Trade. Maybe ask a Clover Company representative or Bruno.</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>Was there any explanation on how the different contents were governed?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There is still need to discuss the central territories, victoria, the blightlands, and Oudste just for the continent I reside on.</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any special landmarks on the continents?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Several but I can mostly answer on those on the one I reside on. It might be easier however to narrow down to a specific region of a country within a continent. The world is a very big place afterall.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>I think it would be cool to have a competition about making maps for belthas</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>How do you recommend we judge it?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>by basic accuracy to the information provided, but more importantly on style and creativity</p>

<h3>NOTE: Interdepartmental Work &amp; Friendly Competition from October 28th, 2021</h3>
<p>This will be today‚Äôs interdepartmental work coming in joint from Culture, Alchemy and Planar Studies Departments, regarding the relevant lecture that was given earlier this week. Culture is seeking applicants to <strong>create a map based on the geography lecture</strong>, limited to one continent discussed in the lecture. Completed information based on the aforementioned lecture. This work will have a competitive nature to it, and will be taking place as this the competition for this week as well. DPC will be awarded for completeness and the proper departments will be informed of the work. There will be a material reward (<i>"Merchandise, a uniquely crafted reward, or gift card" - Blaise</i>) for the map that has the highest degree of accuracy, as they will be compared to a map that Culture already has of these areas. The next few lectures in the coming weeks will be a series on geography within PM-1, these may prove beneficial to you as you create your maps. <strong>You have 10 intervals to compete this task</strong> and submit your maps within Culture Interdepartmental text channel.</p>
