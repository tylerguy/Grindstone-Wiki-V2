<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From February 22nd, 2022</i></span></p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>Today will be a continuation from our previous lecture. We gave additional time for questions previously but I will allow 15 minutes to ask any follow up questions before I proceed.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>You have 15 minutes for follow up questions</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AUZ505: Literature question: are there famous books/stories shared between Planes (overlapping not only in space but in culture)? Or are books typically plane specific. Do you know any important books of our plane?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are several stories that have common themes that overlay but nothing precisely overlapping that I am aware of.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>if you tried to summon something without specificity, could you just end of with a chunk of the area you wanted?</p>
  <p>as in, if you wanted something on the ground, would you carry over a piece of the dirt also</p>
  <p>also could you elaborate on the Shadow, I don't remember reading about it</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Yes</p>
  <p>I can elaborate</p>
  <p>If you summon without specificity you may not get a chunk of area but you will get something similar to what you attempted to summon. With less and less specificity it becomes less and less certain what you will summon</p>
  <p>As for the Shadow, it is part of the unique reality of PM-1.</p>
  <p>You see, PM-1 refers to one plane that has frequent and some constant overlays with two other planes. The Shadow and the Etherial.</p>
  <p>For this reason we also call PM-1 Prime. Our world in a sense is the Prime while being influenced by the Shadow and the Etherial.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ok</p>
  <p>What are the different characteristics in shadow and etherial? Does anyone inhabit those planes?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Unfortunately most discussions on the shadow and etherial are Need to Know and a higher clearance than what I can speak of here but I can speak on some of the planar interactions which are unique.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ok</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Salt for instance, but only in large quantities that is also close together, when placed on the material plane will produce solid walls to things interacting in most overlays on the etherial.</p>
  <p>The shadow is most often utilized for traveling spells that require another plane. As a reminder the "traveling" schools are Summoning, Dismissal, and Translocation.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So basically, if we have overlay over some space, and there's salt in the Material, any salt caught in garnier packets that carry over laws from the Etherial will produce a solid wall? This is from naturalization, or would that be too quick?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>This is seemingly instant though that is because it is difficult to study. It is not by naturalization.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Aye. So then is this due to some complicated interaction done with garnier packets that we've not yet been able to fully investigate?</p>
  <p>Or maybe the salt itself isn't modified, but the natural laws of the Etherial create a "barrier" around salt?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Wait what is the wall made of</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Unfortunately I am limited in my understanding here and the next Planar Studies lecturer will be better suited. I am not a member of Planar Studies. I can however forward a reference request.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Yeah sounds good.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: Wait what is the wall made of</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That I'm also uncertain of, nor the height of the wall. Though some will brine materials to create rooms for safe storage.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>hmm interesting</p>
  <p>can you summon something from a different plane?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>You in fact can only summon things from a different plane.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Though summoning from further rings is more difficult.</p>
  <p>Any last questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I'm all good.</p>

<h3>Naturalization and Banishment</h3>
<p>As stated previously banishment will return an entity back to the plane it is naturalized to. This however shows that naturalization is an all or nothing phenomena with a creature who has not fully naturalized being treated as a new arrival though even returning with frequency to a plane seems to do nothing to the required time to naturalize. This is all to say that a naturalized entity must be on plane for an extended period of time and not leave to be naturalized. The entity however does not seem to start over the time required to naturalized if they are in an overlay. The entity also will typically naturalize as a whole and at once with a few exceptions. There have been accounts of extra-planar field researchers banishing themselves and returning without materials they brought with them. I will not elaborate on the accounts though some comical.</p>
<p>Experimental data suggests that objects in most variations of Garnier packer ratios within an overlay are not subject to naturalization. This experiment had an overlay with two satellite planes and natural material from one exist in an area of extreme time dilation. No noticeable change was observed outside of what to be expected from the passage of time. This experiment was conducted again with a foreign material and had similar results.</p>
<p>I will break now for questions</p>
<h3>Question Break and Planar Discourse</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>i kinda want to know aobut those accounts lol</p>
  <p>also i know you can't exactly measure how long naturalization takes, but can you give a rough estiamte</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It is difficult to say. Gen, Qoseem provide her swift and fair judgment, naturalized to EXT-111 prior to her return to PM-1 and was able to naturalize back to PM-1 over her stay. From what I have seen it can take a few years for people to naturalize.</p>
  <p>I hope I don't naturalize here.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>couldn't you just visit PM-1 again?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So if a subject from Plane A is fully in Plane B, it takes time to naturalize, and we can think of it as a progress bar. If the subject is relocated to an overlay of Plane A and Plane B, this progress bar stops, (I don't think it continues since you mentioned that objects in an overlay with Garnier packets don't seem to naturalize based on that experiment), and if the subject relocates to Plane A, its naturalization progress bar to Plane B goes to zero?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: couldn't you just visit PM-1 again?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I could but honestly I don't know what the experience might be like. I cannot know until I experience it.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>hm ok</p>
  <p>how hard is planar travel once you have already travelled to the plane you are going to</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: So if a subject from Plane A is fully in Plane B, it takes time to naturalize, and we can think of it as a progress bar. If the subject is relocated to an overlay of Plane A and Plane B, this progress bar stops, (I don't think it continues since you mentioned that objects in an overlay with Garnier packets don't seem to naturalize based on that experiment), and if the subject relocates to Plane A, its naturalization progress bar to Plane B goes to zero?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: how hard is planar travel once you have already travelled to the plane you are going to</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is exceptionally difficult to travel planes. How I do it is I go to a designated IA field office with a number of very skilled experts in translocation who for a very calculated aetherial exhaust. We also have our ways of hiding the large exhaust. Once the overlay is created I simply follow instructions for travel. I am by no means a translocation expert either. I'm certain you are tired of hearing that by now but as I would like to remind you I am from Infernal Affairs and I assist research operations and movement of information, I am not a researcher myself.</p>
  <p>Are there any further questions regarding the topic?</p>
  <p>If there are no more questions I will open up to all questions for Planar Studies. I will do my best to answer. That which I cannot we can have record of for when another expert joins.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So I guess a question on the geometry of the universe. So from previous notes, I figured the universe to be a 5D hourglass in the sense of the entire universe lies on the surface of this hourglass. However I noticed that there were a few mentions on aether in the aetherial matrix primarily flowing over dimensions 4 and 5, with some variations into dimensions 1 to 3.</p>
  <p>Is there a geometric reason for this? Why wouldn't it flow five dimensionally in an <i>equal</i> manner?</p>
  <p>Could it be that the dimensions of the universe are partitioned by planes, like we define the first three dimensions to be those that we observe in our planes, and the other two are defined to be what's outside our observed plane, the aetherial matrix and whatever unobservable part of our planes closed off by our 3D senses?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>This is how I understand it though a Planar researcher might say that it is "almost true" and the truest geometry more complicated. This is conventionally the easiest way to think of it however though when aether has entered in plane to be programmed it seems to rapidly move outwards in observable 3-dimensional space.</p>
  <p>We utilize two models for the universe and both imperfect. Maybe we should have an exercise sometime where you propose a different model though I'm not sure it would be a reasonable ask.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Interesting... how did we conclude the universe to be an hourglass? Any particular experiment?</p>
  <p>I would assume there'd be some observation of radial expulsion of aether from the 8th ring, but I could be wrong I guess.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I know it was used to explain time dilations but the math and theory is far beyond my understanding though from what I've observed you might have the necessary background. I'm very excited to hand over the reigns to a Planar Researcher and see you two discuss.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I see. Also, time dilation, how did we first notice that? Did someone stumble into the second ring by accident and have time pass differently, or can you gauge time dilation based on how time flows on different parts of the plane that have different 4th and 5th dimensional coordinates?</p>
  <p>Or is it like, time flow is constant on a ring, but takes sudden steps as you move to a different ring? I think that "constant time flow on the same ring" thing makes more sense, otherwise we'd notice time dilation in our own universe that is not due to gravitational interactions at different points I guess. Unless our instruments aren't precise enough, hm.</p>
  <p>My formulas based on extreme conditions seem to imply an exponential function for time dilation though, interesting...</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>First discovery was simple, it was the observation of how much time passed in a further ring versus a closer one. There are even hoy texts that reference it. It is uncertain of who and when it was first discovered. The difference in time within a plane are generally insignificant but theoretically even in your plane there might be the most minor of dilations somewhere. There are instruments and we utilize now to help us map the universe albeit slowly and explain dilations. The observed data is why we have been able to theorize another side, a place beyond the 8th ring. What we do know is that the rate is exponential in some way and approaches infinity. The experience does not change for the observer but 10 years one place might only be a year elsewhere. Some field researchers find they worked for a very long time only to come back to their family only seeing them leave earlier that interval.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I see, so planar travel's been happening for a very long time then, yeah?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Not always on purpose but before UMAD there were others and less organized means of doing so. The approach we take is very Toristic.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Aye. Makes sense. If planar travel just requires Aetherial Exhaust, I guess even during the Primal Era, letting Aether flow out of its aeonization hole long enough could allow travel to another plane. I just wonder how long that'd take, which might bottleneck how many times it would happen to people.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Planar travel is as old as overlays which have always been natural occurrences. Who knows how many of your own were Planar travelers in the past. Aetherial exhaust is the most direct way of causing it but in very, very rare circumstances the right situation can present with the movement of aether to travel without people interacting or causing exhuast.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh yeah, of course. Forgot about overlays for a second lol.</p>
  <p>So I guess two last things, on measuring time dilation. I know that we can check the oscillation frequencies of aether waves to observe time dilation, and I believe this was used to mathematically formulate the phenomenon itself, how were those systems set up? Did you have one guy on Plane A and a guy on Plane B (where I assume there are wildly different time dilations in A and B) compare the period of aether waves after checking with aeonization holes?</p>
  <p>Did you have, like, an overlay between A and B, and the two guys observe their own aether flow and the other guy's aether flow from their planes' perspective?</p>
  <p>And finally, is time dilation <i>solely</i> a factor of current 5D location of the plane, or is it also encoded within the natural laws? Like a plane from Ring 7, if it ended up in Ring 1, would still appear to be heavily time dilated from the perspective of a plane from and in Ring 1?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>To answer your last question first, something this extreme is not really ever observed both naturally or by exhaust. The level of exhaust required to create an overlay between the 7th and 1st ring would be incredible and would require inconceivably good timing but if we were ever able to do something like this there are several experiments that I'm certain would make researchers salivate. There is a believed link to packet ratios and the time dilations but this suggests validity to a different model for overlays which academically is no longer utilized and suggests a sort of movement within an overlay instead of a packet presence. As we understand it the 5D location in relation to the center, ring 8, is the only real determining factor of time dilations though some theories we have discovered on your plane, as well as your own experimental evidence, does give pause to some of our understanding of the Belthidian laws and structure of the universe.</p>
  <p>The evidence for measuring dilations are actually quite simpler and require reflecting aetherial waves off of what are simply referred to as "anomalies" which is a cheap term for things we have discovered that are likely not planes within the aetherial matrix. Unfortunately these are not things I can elaborate on here.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ooh. I dunno if you can elaborate on this, but is that measurement of time dilation similar to something we have on EXT-918 called the Michelson-Morley experiment, if you're familiar?</p>
  <p>Like, have one arm of the apparatus aligned along Ring 1, the other arm transverse, and measure the difference in return time for the aether waves.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>My lack of familiarity unfortunately fails me here. I can however add this to the list for the Planar Researcher in the future to address. I will however note this experiment for further consideration.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, fair enough.</p>
  <p>But do you ultimately bounce aether waves off different anomalies, say one in ring 1, and one in a different ring, then measure difference of return time?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As I understand it, yes.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Yep, that do be soundin' pretty Michelson-Morleyey.</p>
  <p>Anyways, I think that's all my questions, thanks for the help.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p><span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Infernal Affairs</span> 5 DPC to Name please</p>
  <p>I hope to get you in contact with an expert as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>I'll be retiring for now. Next lecture we will step away from Planar.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Aye, sounds good. Have a good night and a lovely interval to follow! See ya!</p>
