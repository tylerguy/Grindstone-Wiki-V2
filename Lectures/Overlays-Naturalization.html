<p><span class="text-small"><i>From February 15th, 2022</i></span></p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>The lecture will be beginning shortly but first I will address any immediate follow up questions from previous lectures.</p>
<p>As a reminder, I am not an expert on Planar Studies however what you are learning is at a survey level.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Any immediate questions before I begin?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So the transfer from A to B on the native plane during overlay (translocation), you perceive no distance travelled but you indeed physically travel (somehow) on the native plane, like the overlapping plane is “carrying” you to B?</p>
  <p>I think I’ll just leave it at that for now, just a clarification question I guess.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>To split hairs a moment when we mention travel and movement there should be a distinction between travel from A to B through movement or sudden displacement. &nbsp;No work is observed by the subject of translocation but the subject does displace.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So no physical work applied to subject, no physical movement, but it’s like, the plane itself “shifts” without applying work to subject?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>If I were able to provide a visual I would but I will do my best here based on my limited understanding.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, but new coordinates are still different, so there has to be some motion in the universe.</p>
  <p>Ah okay.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I'm being told now that our expressions might differ from yours which may complicate some lecture material... &nbsp;let me try to reframe.</p>
  <p>When the subject is in location A,B,C,D,E with it existing in plane of existence occupying 5 dimensional volume (not certain if that is the right word here) V1 overlaps with plane with volume V2 the 3-dimensional subject may not experience motion but when V2 leaves space over V1 the subject may "move" and find new location A,B,C,d,e.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>When you say V2 leaves space over V1, is V2 static or not moving in this, or does it move?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Planes are amorphous and dynamic. Overlays occur when space is shared. Aetherial waves do not move planes, it is the absence of aether that makes a plane fill the void produced according to experimentation. I could not begin to explain this however as I am not an expert.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ah right, yeah that makes sense.</p>
  <p>Like two bubbles making a Venn diagram in 5D space.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Correct, at the center is the overlay</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Well, bubbles with changing shapes.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Theoretically, if there was not aether then all planes would simultaneously be in the same location according to my understanding.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>How “big” is the overlay? Or does it not work like that</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Overlays vary in size. The limitation as to why a plane doesn't simply fill another plane I do not know. One article I read was on something called Prennian strain.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Do you measure 5d stuff in like loaves^5</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So, I’m afraid I didn’t quite get it if it was explained, so what does it mean when V2 “leaves space” over V1? This just means overlay in general?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: When the subject is in location A,B,C,D,E with it existing in plane of existence occupying 5 dimensional volume (not certain if that is the right word here) V1 overlaps with plane with volume V2 the 3-dimensional subject may not experience motion but when V2 leaves space over V1 the subject may "move" and find new location A,B,C,d,e.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also should the new location be “a,b,c,d,e” since while 4th and 5th dimensions vary slightly, first three vary significantly so they wouldn’t be A,B,C?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: Do you measure 5d stuff in like loaves^5</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Loaf is very....colloquial. We at UMAD have been attempting to create standard units.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Oh very cool</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>A slight discourse, work on our plane has redefined units in terms of fundamental constants that pertain to physics.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: So, I’m afraid I didn’t quite get it if it was explained, so what does it mean when V2 “leaves space” over V1? This just means overlay in general?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It means when the overlay ends. When the general space of V1 overlapping V2 ends by movement of one or the other.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ah okay.</p>
  <p>So when V2 has its boundaries shrink away from V1, our subject somehow ends up at a different coordinate. Significant in dimensions 1-3, not so much in 4-5. <s>I wonder how this relates to possibly different dynamics between the dimensions.</s></p>
  <p>But yeah that's basically all my questions.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Your thoughts make me want to refer you to a specific researcher in the future Name</p>
  <p>Though you'll enjoy future lectures on kaleidoscopic and telescopic planar overlays.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I do enjoy kaleidoscopes. Pretty colorful pictures in general actually.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As preview to that lecture, an overlay does not need to be only 2 planes but can be more.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ooh complicated venn diagrams</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Makes sense.</p>
  <p>Love me a good Venn diagram.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>i think this was said before but are overlays predictable?</p>
  <p>and if so, how do you predict them</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p><s>all of the planes that exist in one overlay would be chaotic as heck</s></p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>and apart from volume and location, what characteristics does an overlay have</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Some can be forced, others assumed, and still others can be calculated.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>how do you force an overlay?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: and apart from volume and location, what characteristics does an overlay have</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Volume, location, and moment. Though how one interacts with another is a large part of Planar Studies.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: how do you force an overlay?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Aetherial Exhaustion. This is how we conduct extra planar travel.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok</p>
  <p>that's what happens when too much aether is summated right</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Correct though too much is relative. Sometimes it is done on purpose.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p>or like it's summated but not used</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p>This causes aetherial backlash</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p>I'll give this 6 more minutes then I'll move on.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I have no questions xD</p>
  <p>just watching</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oopsies last minute question. If we visualize two planes as regions vacated of aether in 5D space, overlap is when these two regions overlap, would that mean they become one region? How is the distribution of Garnier packets determined then?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The idea of Venn diagrams suggest that definite borders exist, how is that so if planar boundaries determined by Aether, which has been vacated?</p>
  <p>If it’s too loaded, it’s fine if I wait for future researchers.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The planes do have definite boarders but are not inhibited by each other. &nbsp;They can share the same space. &nbsp;Why they don't completely overlap in overlay is not something I can assist with but again it involves the aforementioned strain.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Coolioni and cheese, got it, thanks for answering my questions lol.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is boarder just spelled like that on pm-1?</p>
  <p>since we would use border</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>No, it was a typographical error.</p>
  <p>I will return to lecture.</p>
  <p>Also... my device autocorrects to that sometimes.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p><s>The eternal pain of the modern age.</s></p>

<h3>Naturalization</h3>
<p>Naturalization is the process of a subject that is extraplanar to the plane by which they exist on changing characteristics due to constant exposure. We will discuss what some of these seemingly malleable characteristics are and how little we know about why they change later. We will however discuss a little on what they are. First however I will reference some information from Aetherial Studies. As a reminder there is Summoning, Dismissal, and Translocation schools. All three of these schools of aetherial casting have one thing in common, heavy reliance on the familiarity with Planar Studies.</p>
<p>Summoning can best be thought of casting a large net and pulling something from one plane to another. Specificity causes more filters for what the net is trying to collect and can increase the complexity of the casting. Translocation occurs with forced overlays by aetherial exhaustion. The most relevant school however to the discussion of naturalization is Dismissal magic. When dismissed, the subject can be banished to a plane that it is naturalized to. Dismissal magic has many other uses like dismantling tethers but we will also not discuss tethers and their features at this time. While dismissal and naturalization have been well researched there is still much to learn about them as well. In time we hope you identify the weak points in our study and assist in research, especially those in Planar Studies.</p>
<p>It is uncertain how long naturalization takes exactly but the measured changes by currently investigated variables seem very minimal. For instance, a subject from the Shadow may only differ in a period of a few ticks from naturalization from an identical subject from a plane on ring 3 once relocated to PM-1. Note however that studies are limited due to the length of time it takes for a subject to naturalize is considerably lengthy. There are some subjects such as elementals or divine servants that differ wildly in their naturalization period. It should be noted forced naturalization due to continued exposure to a plane for a divine servant is generally both dangerous and may cause the subject harm or upset them.</p>
<p>I'm breaking for questions</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Is there any questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a relation between naturalization and plane touch? My assumptions of the latter suggest that it is a result of being on a different plane, so I assume that also means you’d naturalize to it. Not sure on time scales though.</p>
  <p>Like maybe if there’s a “glitch” in naturalization?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Those suffering plane touch do not adjust in a way by naturalization that positively impacts their condition usually. I do not know of any studies however that have attempted to link the two. I do not know if there is a solid Toristic reason for this or simply there has been no strong thesis presented that was awarded grant money for research.</p>
  <p>Once you make researcher perhaps you could speak with a thesis advisor or propose the research for funding.</p>
  <p>Any further questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I'm all good.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a limit for what kinds of things Naturalize? As in different things and to what limit they can Naturalize to?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As far as I understand anything will eventually naturalize given enough time. I would not however expect food with a poor shelf life to naturalize before it spoils.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Fair enough xD</p>

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>I will be stopping early for the day and returning to this lecture later. If you have any lecture questions on this lecture you may @ me in lecture questions only and I will get to them while between lectures.</p>
