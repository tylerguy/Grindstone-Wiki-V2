<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From January 3rd, 2022</i></span></p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>Alright new lecture. I'm going to make puns for two hours</p>
<p>You complain, and this is what you get.</p>
<p>Good evening. I am Researcher White of the Culture Department, and I was suddenly given two hours to prepare a lecture. So naturally, I procrastinated. Aggressively.</p>
<p>Instead of walls and walls of text being dumped in advanced preparation, today will be a little more impromptu and interpersonal. There will be a brief discussion on the history of literature, followed by some examples of various kinds of literature that exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, the lecture will likely only last an hour with a little extra time for final questions.</p>
<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>Literature is essentially a written (or in your case, printed) work that withstands the test of time, and is essential to its genre. There is no real reason to bother with the history of literature itself, as that is a complicated subject that involves a blend of cultural and religious histories over several eras. Instead, we'll be focusing on certain topics within literature and some examples of written works that are popularized within those.</p>
<p>Of course books are difficult to come by on PM-1 and are quite expensive and valuable, as each must be painstakingly transcribed by hand if you want to create a copy of an original work. Attention to detail is necessary to prevent translation errors, and not all concepts translate across language barriers. While it is true that some programming exists to transcribe written works using aetherial mechanisms, only insanely rich assholes do that. So there is not an easily accessible means of mass-production; nor is the literacy rate of most nations high enough to warrant a need for mass production.</p>
<p>I will take questions for a few moments.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Is UMAD working on a way for mass production of written works? Like a printing press???</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>I was about to ask</p>
  <p>How is there not some version of a "copy quill" that has programmed ability to make copies?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I’m assuming it would be hard to make and upkeep that many</p>
  <p>Programming fades over time</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>That is unnecessary at this time, so no. There is an aetherial mechanism, as mentioned, which can transcribe.</p>
  <p>"only insanely rich assholes do that."</p>
  <p>That would mean us, as an institution, yes.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Hmmm I see I see</p>
  <p>Makes sense</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Of course we also have Research Assistants we can make do the dirty work.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Is research being done to find a means of streamlining the process, or has it been left fallow at the present?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>That would be a question for the Aetherial Studies department.</p>
  <p>I do not Need to Know.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>We are busy making fireballs</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I figured as such xD</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>What about libraries? I think ive asked it before honestly so feel free to ignore. Are there any initiatives to assist with the unlettered?</p>
  <p>or is it a "not at the top of the priority list"</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>How much of the population is considered lettered if I may ask?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Libraries exist, as both state-owned but publicly accessible, as well as private collections.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: How much of the population is considered lettered if I may ask?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That depends on the population. Belthas? Oudste? Victoria? Gijuntou? Subterran mountainfolk?</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, all of them and a global average please.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Regardless - "not many" is an applicable answer. I would estimate no more than 35% of any population can write, and at best maybe 50% can read.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>That's fair</p>
  <p>I suppose Belthas I’m the more curious about</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>Is UMAD, as the insanely rich assholes ||i'm telling blaise ||, taking any initiatives on transcribing? For the greater good? Institution library? etc?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>I discourage bias.</p>
  <p>We already have a library that is accessible, with permission.</p>
  <p>I will return to lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>thank you for your answers!</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Thank you! Tell us more :0</p>

<h3>Types of Literature</h3>
<p>Many kinds of literary works exist, some for the sake of entertainment while others purely as a means of study and theorycrafting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many of you who recently took the abridged <i>REEEEE</i> may recall, a certain play was mentioned, called Arabella's Fortune. It was written a number of years ago at the start of the Fur War between Victoria and the Blue Orc Territories, as a piece of entertainment media with politically charged themes at its center.</p>
<p>Through the course of the story, Arabella uses her position and power within society to undermine and demean or endanger the lives of others for her personal amusement, with no recognized consequence. It proved disastrous as a performance piece that left crowds angry and seeking some sort of catharsis or release - which was intentional by its author as a means of stirring up the hearts of the people against the aristocracy. The play was quickly banned as a public danger, and its author arrested for inciting riots and disturbing the peace. The work was taken and turned into a book however, which appears in many collections due to its power as a political piece.</p>
<p>There are popular works that exist as careful transcriptions of the journals of aetherial scholars or religious scholars of old, that document the growth of ideas and understanding of the natural laws of the universe, or the spreading and growth of various faiths.</p>
<p>A popular piece that relates to Planar studies are "Introduction to Interdimensions" which is considered a very concise and layman or sophomoric guide to the theory behind planes and their relations to each other, as well as how the principles of different schools of magic relate to planar position and movement of them within the aether.</p>
<p>Another more advanced piece of Planar studies is "The Sum of All Vertices" which attempts to accurately map out planar positions, and goes into depth on the theory and mathematics behind schools of magic like Dismissal and Summoning.</p>
<p>One of my particular favorites was not intended as a book, but was created as one nonetheless. It is called "Inhio" based off of the word covet/desire, and it is a series of poems and love letters exchanged between two people who were very much in love, but kept apart due to political marriages. Decades later, when both had passed, the estate of one of them was being sold off and the letters were found in a hidden compartment of an ornate desk.</p>
<p>Rather than simply disposing of them, the man who found the letters was moved by the words within them and had them compiled together, and transcribed into small books to share with others who might be moved by the letters. Both sides of the love affair were kept anonymous for the sake of avoiding scandal, and this added air of mystery made it a very popular piece that spread among young men and women.</p>
<p>I will take some questions at this point.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Has the concept of tropes been recognized yet?</p>
  <p><strong>Map</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a form of “wattpad” shivers in your plane?</p>
  <p><strong>alcaris/allie[any/all]</strong></p>
  <p>y'all these questions gonna make me cry</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Map: Is there a form of “wattpad” shivers in your plane?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>…No.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues: Has the concept of tropes been recognized yet?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Yes, there is a recognition of things that are trope or fall into a very obvious template or style.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>How thoroughly have they been categorized?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Some attempt to subvert this, while others accept that such things exist because they are iconic and essential.</p>
  <p>Map</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Researcher White: …No.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I can sleep peacefully tonight knowing that :relieved:</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Well Discord just crashed while I was mid-pragraph so...</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>Is or Was there a type of... "secret society" of authors, that produced anonymous works that would be considered controversial?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Not getting that answer, Ace.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Map: I can sleep peacefully tonight knowing that :relieved:</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bruno didn't know what fanfiction was, it might be getting research funds though :grimacing:</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Fair</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>mediocre: Is or Was there a type of... "secret society" of authors, that produced anonymous works that would be considered controversial?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many works are left anonymous due to controversy and punishment, but I would not say there is a secret society that go out of their way to do this, no.</p>
  <p>The most likely culprits would be a religious order... Who wouldn't be very secret because they'd put their god's name and holy symbol all over that.</p>
  <p><strong>Map</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>mediocre: Bruno didn't know what fanfiction was, it might be getting research funds though :grimacing:</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In what aspect? Funds to write it? To learn about it? Is someone gonna have to watch the kissing booth trilogy “for research”?</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>Well, depending on the god, I could see. With that, assuming new* religious orders don't pop up frequently?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Map: In what aspect? Funds to write it? To learn about it? Is someone gonna have to watch the kissing booth trilogy “for research”?</li>

  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Religious orders are created when there is either a need for them to embody a domain of their god and expand the reach of the faith... or there is a schism within a faith, and clergy and order members go rogue, establishing a new sect within the faith for themselves.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>and they're obnoxious? all of them, all the time?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>What?</p>
  <p>I suppose some people feel that way. I cannot speak on a universally empiric point, however.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>was based solely off this, my apologies.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&gt; Who wouldn't be very secret because they'd put their god's name and holy symbol all over that</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>They're big on brand loyalty, is how I'd put it.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Even the existence of a deity is public knowledge, the membership and disposition of their clergy might not be</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>I see, I see</p>
  <p>How is literature from religious orders handled? any specific way? in the eyes of the government or... generally. I guess that depends on how religious orders are viewed generally. i guess thats culture :thinking: either way</p>

<h3>Forbidden Texts</h3>
<p>To wrap things up before final questions, there are of course... The <i>forbidden texts</i>. Not all information is or should be publicly available or even allowed within private collections. It is rare, but some works are considered so dangerous or controversial that knowing about them is considered enough to question your intent and character - and owning them is a serious offense. If the government of your nation may not necessarily punish you, the court of public opinion and social peers will essentially amount to a death sentence for your reputation and that of your family.</p>
<p>I will take final questions.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any specific areas that are widely considered taboo or proscribed?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Certain faiths and sects of very select gods that whose <i>worship </i>is not outlawed necessarily, but whose religious texts and practices are. "You can worship them if you want - but you aren't allowed to know how to do it" is I suppose how you'd put it? Outlawing a god entirely will put your nation at risk of that god and any faiths that have a strong tie to it. So it is better to simply make the owning of materials and information illegal, and limit the ways in which one <i>can</i> worship them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Examples<a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Info/The-Gods"><sup>[1]</sup></a> of this would be Ilkin, Prokopis, Lay'Ora, Caubomen, Feterflesh Offalmaw, Khazak, Arevik, Au'pak, Bazhanvats Mt'ker, Felicity, Oberon, Alligans, Aytac, Albert, Miles...</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Just a few, I see</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>|| infin.... look at this... more gods ||</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>There are also cults or pseudo-religious sects that do not follow and worship that which is Perfect and Beautiful, but instead choose to worship things that are not gods. Idolatry. Such groups are often deemed insane and dangerous.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>What differentiates an idol from a god. Mainstream acceptance?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>No.</p>
  <p>A god is that which is Perfect and Beautiful.</p>
  <p>An idol is a thing that takes the place of that in your focus and worship.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, a simple and objective measurement</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Gods are gods.</p>
  <p>Things that are not gods, are not gods.</p>
  <p>Thus, idols.</p>
  <p><strong>Map</strong></p>
  <p>How do you know about the forbidden texts?</p>
  <p><strong>Pixellou</strong></p>
  <p>Simply saying the word “forbidden” has me reallllly wanting to read one</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>I'm a scholar in the culture department. It is necessary to know that some texts are Need to Know.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It does not mean I know what they are.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, but what is the difference between a humanistic, monastic system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers, and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment?</p>

  </ul>
  <p>yeah that checks out</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Forgive me, the initial questions were asked in good faith, but we got on a tangent that gave me a chance to quote Pratchett</p>
  <p>Although I am still curious about how exactly the distinction between “god” and “idol” is made</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>I could not explain it in any more simplicity and clarity than I already did.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Then can you explain it with intricacy and nuance?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Are there questions related to literature?</p>
  <p>This sounds like studying previous lectures is in order, and is not related to the current one.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, I see</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>God = A God. That which is Perfect and Beautiful. You can find a list of them somewhere where a bunch of other cool information is stored.</p>
  <p>Idol = anything worshipped, that is not a god.</p>

  <p>Are there texts that are required to be read for any particular reason? Or maybe not required, but is suggested that they be read for what they contain?</p>

  <p>Oh, yeah. Did we have a true "star crossed lovers" tale?</p>
  <p><strong>Pixellou</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues: Although I am still curious about how exactly the distinction between “god” and “idol” is made</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Makes me think of the story in the Christian bible in which some people choose to worship a golden statue instead of the Christian god. God is god, the statue is an idol standing in place of a god. But I guess the distinction depends on whether you believe in the power of the idol vs the existence of god.</p>
