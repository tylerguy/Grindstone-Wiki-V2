<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From December 20th, 2021</i></span></p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>Today we will be covering the first lecture in a series of lectures on Overlays and the Natural Laws. &nbsp;As always I would like to remind you I am not a Planar Studies expert, I am a member of IA and I recommend that you again distinguish between Natural Laws and Belthidian Laws for this lecture. &nbsp;All lectures at present are part of a survey series and have general information about different subjects within each department. &nbsp;When we enter more advanced topics a Lecturer or even Senior Lecturer from the appropriate department will be presenting at all times. &nbsp;I will do my best to answer any questions you may have however on this subject.</p>
<h3>Bourdicot Effect</h3>
<p>The Bourdicot Effect is not named after a person but instead a textile which is in turn named after the place it developed. &nbsp;The Bourdicot Effect is used to explain the partial characteristics of the Natural Laws within an overlay. &nbsp;The Bourdicot Effect was proposed by Enchanter Iaen Garnier over a century ago and it is still used in consideration of the study of overlays now. &nbsp;The Victorian Enchanter was originally interested in translocative magics but found determining more specific locations of translocation difficult without unintended side effects. &nbsp;Those side effects and their severity became the starting point of their study and theory.</p>
<p>Simply put it is believed that during a planar overlay you are not uniquely in two different places at the same time but partially in one place or another. &nbsp;To explain this within the ideas of 5-dimensional space caused a lot of frustration for early mathematicians (and eventually led to advancements in mathematics) that led to comfortable explanations for most phenomena being only expressions of real space. &nbsp;While some theories have been proven to not be universally true under this comfortable math Garnier's explanation has persisted still as aforementioned. &nbsp;This has been important to our current understanding of planes and how they interact in overlays. &nbsp;According to the Bourdicot Effect planes occupy tiny spaces that almost randomly, or so it seems, to exist one place or another. &nbsp;One plane might occupy 3-dimensional space for the observer in very tiny packets all over their body while experiencing another plane where that plane does not occupy. &nbsp;The random placement in analogous to the Bourdicot textile something you might call Calico.</p>
<p>I will break for first questions</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>just trying to catch up :sweat_smile:</p>
  <p>This might be a bit crude, but I am smol brain</p>
  <p>ehhhh question retracted.</p>
  <p>Please Name, ask away lol</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So when you say a plane can take up 3D space and experience another plane it is not a part of, you mean the first plane intersects with the second plane in a 3D volume, and the second plane differs in 4th and 5th dimensional coordinates? And these intersections in 3D volumes are random?</p>
  <p>Also, a smaller question, so planes don't necessarily have to be 5-dimensional in structure? They can be purely 3D with no 4th or 5th dimensional components? Sorta like a 2D disk in a cube of water (Aetherial matrix).</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As I understand it, which again I'm no expert, all planes have a 5-dimensional structure but in the 4th and 5th may occupy the same coordinate space but fail to do so in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. When they do occupy the same 4th and 5th dimensional space the can push and pull in 3 dimensional space and for the observer be present at the same time in 3 dimensional space when they only experience it a such. This idea explains a partial character of natural laws from different planes sometimes.</p>
  <p>There is something called the Crutz conjecture that as it can be assumed by the name is itself based in certain assumptions. The Crutz conjecture is a more advanced topic however I will not be covering that explains why the <i>sometimes</i> is necessary and has been used in proofs against the Bourdicot Effect.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Okay, so 4th and 5th dimensional coordinates match between planes, and this sorta pushes and pulls the observer between planes at locations with same 3D coordinates?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Sort of, I'll be discussing Garnier packets more shortly.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Okay.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>These or small packets of 3-dimensional space that is experienced as one plane or another.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p><i>just sit here and nod like I understand all this, that's how I got through college</i></p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues:<i> just sit here and nod like I understand all this, that's how I got through college</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Planar Studies is a fascinating subject but it can be one of the more intimidating ones. Hence why I repeatedly mention I am no expert.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So the Bourdicot Effect is just how these Garnier packets are randomly placed?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The Bourdicot Effect explains that partial character of planes is experienced due to approximate overlay. &nbsp;This is very next in the lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Aye, okay.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Any more questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good. Dunno about anyone else.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles [He/Him]</strong></p>
  <p>This is too big brain for me :sweat_smile:</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I will continue then.</p>

<h3>Garnier Packets</h3>
<p>The larger the overlay the more evenly distributed the Garnier packets, the small spaces of one plane or another. In a perfect overlay, that is one plane is completely occupying space with another, the distribution would theoretically be 50% of each plane but data shows this is not exactly true and the number slightly fluctuates in time as the movement of planes are dynamic. The Bourdicot Effect lead to this discovery and another very important discovery. To displace between one plane and another you must experience an overlay first. By being present in a space of partial character between two planes you can then move into space of character higher than 50% than the native or originating plane for travel. This was the foundation to the restructuring of translocative spells and the utilization of nearby planes to displace within 3-dimensional space in one plane. In reality the translocated subject experiences a change in dominant plane and then rapidly the dominant plane becomes the native plane again. I'll provide a step by step process of this.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A translocated subject experiences Garnier packets in a specified initial percentage of at least 11% non-native plane.</li>
  <li>The subject "moves" to space where the initial percentage climbs to an even distribution of native and non-native plane.</li>
  <li>With the move the subject becomes effectively off plane as they occupy space where the majority of Garnier packets experienced are non-native.</li>
  <li>In the predominantly non-native space a new space is "moved to" that may differ only slightly in dimension 4 and 5 but in the experienced 1, 2, and 3 they are far apart.</li>
  <li>The character of planes becomes even again.</li>
  <li>The character of native plane dominates and eventually the overlay ends as they separate. &nbsp;This is a full translocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm breaking for questions and then I will elaborate on character of planes within a space.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I think I'm good.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I will continue then.</p>

<h3>Planar Characteristics</h3>
<p>The experienced character of a plane is dependent on the % overlay. Also while one plane may be much larger than another the 3-dminesional space and characteristics observed are only effected by how totally the smaller plane overlays with the larger. If the smaller plane overlays 80% for instance than a region of space would have 40% character. This math changes with more planes and their relative sizes but the exact calculations are not what you might expect. For multi-planar interactions I will allow an expert to talk about them. They are extremely rare but sometimes forced for study.</p>
<p>When % character is mentioned it does not directly explain a phenomena or natural law experienced but it does lend to us studying the natural laws and aid to us making educated guesses to the changes. &nbsp;If for instance a plane on the far edge of the first ring were to overlay with EXT-918 then time would seem to slow down as the character increases but since planes are dynamic the exact experience of time would vary. &nbsp;Perhaps these two planes slight changes dynamically would not lend to extreme shifts in how time is experienced while there but if EXT-918 were to overlay with the second or third ring then the % character would have even more extreme effects on time as the slight shift by the dynamic overlay is experienced.</p>
<p>I'll take questions now.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There is a lot to digest so I want to break frequently for questions regarding Planar Studies.</p>
  <p>I suspect that @ThisIsAName0 might have ideas to some of the math involved in this?</p>
  <p>This is based on observation though I'd love to know your thoughts.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I have quite a few thoughts, but I feel they're a bit outside the scope of the lecture. Conceptually it makes sense though.</p>
  <p>But yeah, no questions for now.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Very well. The direction of the lecture at this point can going many ways so I will open up for discourse. If you have any questions or want to know more specifics then I encourage it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>The next lecture in series will focus more on the idea of keeping planes within a space be it natural or not. &nbsp;This lecture will act as a background for that. &nbsp;We will break now for discourse until time is up.</p>
<h3>General Discourse</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EmeraldStag</strong></p>
  <p>This translocation process and overlays, does the subject have a prolonged exposure and experience of the process or is it instantaneous from their perspective? Or does that wholly depend on the programming?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>May I have a raise?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So would translocation look like this? In terms of distributions of Garnier packets.</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/922654427066822718/IMG_1201.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Researcher White: May I have a raise?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ask Bruno or Janet.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Or does the non-native plane not have to have a 100% dominance of Garnier packets? In that case, it'd be like an overlap of three locations, Native Location A, Non-Native, and Native Location B, which I envision as folding a piece of paper on itself.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Researcher White: May I have a raise?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>yes Dowan, ask Janet</i></p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>EmeraldStag: This translocation process and overlays, does the subject have a prolonged exposure and experience of the process or is it instantaneous from their perspective? Or does that wholly depend on the programming?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It depends a great deal of the programming of the spell. &nbsp;We have learned shortcut over the years however and small subject generalized translocation has become a very fast experience. &nbsp;It also matters where you are translocating in relative 5-dimensional space.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: Or does the non-native plane not have to have a 100% dominance of Garnier packets? In that case, it'd be like an overlap of three locations, Native Location A, Non-Native, and Native Location B, which I envision as folding a piece of paper on itself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A 100% dominance of non-native Garnier packets is ill advised. &nbsp;Any value under 11% of an unintended destination is ill advised.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So it would be like, 89% non-native, 5% native location A, 6% native location B?</p>
  <p>If we're making a shift from A to B.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The "move" I'm referring to is the total shift of A to B by means of non-native which the absolute need of % varies at a given time and given place.</p>
  <p>As you move from 12% A 88% non-native to 11% native that 11% native could move from A to B.</p>
  <p>But I suppose you could imagine it something like folding but how I see it is two spaces folding. Though again, I'm no expert.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So like this, where A suddenly (relative to some timescale I suppose) shifts to B, and that shift of A to B is the analogous folding?</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/922656627490975754/IMG_1202.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p><strong>Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>What happens if you have a 100% dominance of non-native packets?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Also if you want to be very specific with your math, it is 1/9th not 11%</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ace of Rogues: What happens if you have a 100% dominance of non-native packets?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That is Planar Travel.</p>
  <p><strong>Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, I see</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>At 100% dominance the planes are no longer in overlay.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Ah yeah, just harder to get exactly 11/100 with a bunch of diagonal lines lol. Guess should add a tick mark for that.</p>
  <p><strong>Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>So the idea is to take advantage of or create a sweet spot of planar overlay</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ace of Rogues: So the idea is to take advantage of or create a sweet spot of planar overlay</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That allows it to occupy the relative space necessary for travel to the location intended, yes.</p>
  <p>That might mean 60% that might mean 89%.</p>
  <p>It is mostly determined in the moment. Translocation is a dangerous and complicated study. That is why experts are often very well paid but hard to come by.</p>
  <p><strong>Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>The size of the bonus is inversely related to the odds you'll be able to collect it in the end</p>
  <p>A truism in many fields</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So another thing, the move from A to B by using the non-native space, we move in <i>non-native space</i> to a space that has a slightly different 4th and 5th dimensional coordinate but desired 3D coordinates? So do we actually physically move in non-native space?</p>
  <p>Or, does the entire non-native plane just move to where it should be to go to location B?</p>
  <p>I guess that would use enough summation to move a plane?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>This is getting into to some advanced ideas in translocation so again, you may need to ask a real expert. &nbsp;I will however do my best to answer without giving false information and based on my own understanding prior to the opportunity of speaking with an expert.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh okay, yeah if my questions get too technical please tell me lol.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The idea of translocation is to limit actual movement in space as much as possible but instead simply displacing without much travel.</p>
  <p>How with is accomplished is actually an Aetherial Studies question but as I understand it, it is not entirely motionless just perceived as such.</p>
  <p>Also remember you can have a near total overlay of a plane but only experience it over a very small volume 3-dimensionally.</p>
  <p>There are some technical usages of instantaneous demiplanes of circumstance or IDCs for short but that is outside my expertise.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Hm, okay. Yeah I think that's all my questions for now, lest I get too carried away haha. Thanks for everything!</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Why do hot dogs come in packages of ten and hot dog buns come in packages of eight?</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues: Why do hot dogs come in packages of ten and hot dog buns come in packages of eight?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>while a good question, this isnt relevant. i wonder the answer though&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Ace of Rogues: Why do hot dogs come in packages of ten and hot dog buns come in packages of eight?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Capitalist ploy to get us to buy five packages of buns and four packages of dogs.</p>
  <p><strong>EmeraldStag</strong></p>
  <p>You mentioned earlier there were side effects of translocation, assumedly time dilation is one but how severe could they get or this also a question that is not within your expertise?</p>
  <p>I'm obviously not asking for an entire list of what could or could not happen, just a couple of examples would suffice</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>EmeraldStag: You mentioned earlier there were side effects of translocation, assumedly time dilation is one but how severe could they get or this also a question that is not within your expertise?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It depends on the plane and the character present of each. Of course there is always risk of Plane Touch. Translocation specialists on PM-1 often keep to the same non-native plane for all translocation for this reason.</p>
