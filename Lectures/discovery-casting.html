<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>A History of Aetherial Magic Series: Discovery Casting is the second of a three lecture series.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the previous lecture if you have not already. We will be continuing from there.</p>
<h3>Discovery Casting</h3>
<p>Discovery casting was a period where some of the most important concepts and techniques in aetherial casting began to develop such as early ritual casting. The major event that scholars agree that marks the beginning of Discovery casting was the implementation of the Toristic Process. While casting remained still very spiritual in many ways the Toristic process allowed aetherial casting to become more of a study. Through the short period between the creation of this process and the eventual death of Tor he and his students were responsible for initiating an explosion of discoveries allowing aetherial magic to propel itself with practical applications. One markedly unique quality of Discovery Era Aetherial casting is that it did not rely on any practical or small objects at first. As mentioned before it would not be until the classical era that objects and four-points would be utilized as we think of them now.</p>
<p>Discovery casting was the shortest lived period of casting but was very important to continued cultural advancement for many peoples. It assisted in the recovery of a dark era after the fall of the Azalt which occurred not long after the death of Tor. This dark era lasted only about two generations and after rapid discovery led to advancement and opportunities in colonization. Discovery Casting in it's earliest times was considered "not real casting" as it employed more of an empirical approach and there were questions as to if results could actually be known or simply experienced. This allowed the Emperor at the time to suggest it was unnecessary for it to be regulated by the Order of the Magus. There would however be fear fostered in the dark era to lead to aetherial casting to come mostly under control of the Order of the Magus in the future, especially the East.</p>
<p>While casters still utilized the now impractical large areas for casting or Calculi Spaces it allowed them to realize patterns or lack there of with specific geometry of casting. Another realization made was it was more likely to draw more aether if more points of aeonization were made. This was of course before the realization of summation but allowed for early principles of foci, rituals, and exhaust. A singular specialist would often be trained to take on large amounts of aether for only programming into the desired spell. These casters would often not handle the aeonization themselves and would be masters of arithmetic and geometry. They often relied on skills they learned over time keeping the innate casting concept of aetherial casting being also an art. These were the first foci in ritual casting and the others were referred to as "contributors".</p>
<p>Soon new tools for calculations were created that could be handled without the need of manipulation by limbs. Several personal made items such as one discovered to utilize a series of strings so that limited movement was made during the spellcasting but the instruments could assist with calculation. This was until advent of "assisted writing".</p>
<p>Aether seemed to these people as being able to occupy space already occupied by other material. If one could see it they might be able to create shortcuts in casting but also use their general placement to effect the movement of aether with aether already in space. Soon specialists would begin filling small objects with aether, hyper aeonizing them and placing them in patterns to assist with the further movement of aether during large casting. These objects would soon shrink as their understanding allowed for more and more precise instruments. This ultimately lead to both the invention of programming and the early written spells.</p>
<p>The oldest student of Tor would take programming much further with the blessing of the Azalt Emperor.</p>
<p>I will take questions.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>How did these tools that "could be handled without the need of manipulation by limbs" work? The main thing that occurs to me would be tables or lists of common place calculations.</p>
  <p><i><strong>Blaise</strong></i></p>
  <p><i>Usually by quite a</i>bsurd means. Early casters were very creative.</p>
  <p>One old caster utilized hooks embedded in parts of their body and trained themselves to carefully manipulate the tools with other parts of their body. Most of these practices came from an assumption made from ideas of late primal casters.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>In your penultimate note, you note that casters hyper-aeonized objects, placed them in wave patterns, and used them to assist in the movement of Aether, that seems more like summation, using wave interference stuff, no? So how'd that lead to programming?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The idea of programming was arrived at from the want to minimize the material utilized and to create essentially skeletons that allowed manipulation. &nbsp;It was found to be more practical to not hyper aeonize eventually when considering frames.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>One old caster utilized hooks embedded in parts of their body and trained themselves to carefully manipulate the tools with other parts of their body. Most of these practices came from an assumption made from ideas of late primal casters.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That sounds horrifying, but sounds extremely creative</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>And that led to programming by then having the idea of automating the movements of these skeletons which also allowed them to move away from the "creative" tools used by early casters?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>though I am curious, does aetherial casting nowadays require much less physical movement to cast? was physicals movement a must have in the casting process in the past?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>It sounds more like they wanted to limit physical movement or at least additional movement from the invention of these tools.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: though I am curious, does aetherial casting nowadays require much less physical movement to cast? was physicals movement a must have in the casting process in the past?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Significantly more when considering using multiple objects to aeonize and how important ideas of space were in early ideas of casting.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: And that led to programming by then having the idea of automating the movements of these skeletons which also allowed them to move away from the "creative" tools used by early casters?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It led to the idea of programming not out of practicality but quite a bit out of "what if". &nbsp;What if you could create very thin aeonized areas with specificity and minimize material that would otherwise be obstructive?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, the good old "what if I tried this" method of stumbling upon improvements. People truly are the same no matter which plane they are on.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It was also the minimization of material that led to the understanding that some materials readily aeonize and keep while others readily aeonize and release aether. By using diamond dust with a paste or ink they could minimize space for certain instructions. In time this became the written programs or spells you find in a 4-point.</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good for now.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Likewise.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>I'll save mine for the end. Several questions about terms being used, but I'm getting the gist of things</p>

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>I am personally unwell today and may need to continue this lecture in two parts but I will have the second part tomorrow in addition to your new assignment. &nbsp;I will accept some questions for now however.</p>
<h3>Closing Questions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I am unwell today so I will be breaking but I will try to make up for this by answering some questions.</p>
  <p><strong>Ace of Rogues</strong></p>
  <p>Okay, well, first get well soon!</p>
  <p>Yes, I know that's not a question</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Of course! Rest well!</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>In that case, I do have one question that I thought might be answered later in the lecture. You mentioned "assisted writing". What is that?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Very well, I will continue this tomorrow. My apologies for the change in schedule. Perhaps it has been my extended stay here.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>If you are feeling really unwell, feel free to ignore this question for now.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: In that case, I do have one question that I thought might be answered later in the lecture. You mentioned "assisted writing". What is that?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The assisted writing is the processor to programming.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Ah. Thanks!</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>When we continue I will tell you of Desolise, the invention of necromancy, and the early aetherial scare. &nbsp;I will then explain how the use of objects and four points came to be and how the Order of the Magus for some time had a monopoly on most aetherial casting prior to some public resistance.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Sounds really cool. Feel better soon!</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Have a lovely rest! Looking forward to the rest of the lecture!</p>
  <p><strong>EmeraldStag</strong></p>
  <p>thank you for the lecture I hope you feel better~</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Ooooh that’s exciting, I look forward to it! Please rest well and take all the time you need</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>ArcaneIllumination: "ah thanks!"&nbsp;</p>
  <p>actually Arcane: &nbsp;:snoo_calculating:</p>
  <p>also me, usually :hehe:</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>More about half and half.</p>
  <p>I was indeed quite thankful for the quick response in these circumstances.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>...why do I feel like programming is just making funny drawings on paper using Aether capacitors that use geometry to give a specific effect? If it is, it probably was explained before but I forgot or didn't listen lmao. Still not sure how the specific effect comes about though.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: More about half and half.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>you're valid. i'm mostly joking hehe. The lectures come fast and full of good info :PrattHeart:</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I understood. I'm not the best at communicating a tone of taking things with good humor in text.</p>
