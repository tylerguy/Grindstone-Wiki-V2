<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>A History of Aetherial Magic Series: Primal Casting is the first in a series of three lectures. &nbsp;Not all of these may be presented by myself.</p>
<p>We will begin shortly. Do note that we will eventually move to an audio and text format.</p>
<p>Aetherial Studies is a general term used for the study of both theory and practice for both efferent and innate casters. &nbsp;Aetherial studies has a large amount of overlap with other studies such as Planar Studies and its need to understand the Belthidian laws. &nbsp;Aetherial Studies like engineering however is more concerned with the local physical laws for practical casting and only references the Belthidian laws to create educated guesses as to the interactions of other planes when they are necessary. &nbsp;For these lectures we will be focusing on the history of efferent casting and how casting has evolved over the many, many years to become the refined casting it is now. &nbsp;We will begin chronologically with Primal Casting, the original efferent casting.</p>
<h3>Primal Casting</h3>
<p>Primal casting has an uncertain date of origin but is often believed to have come from the observing the actions of the innate casters. &nbsp;After all with innate casters existing alongside natural curiosity it was only a matter of time before someone wondered how they themselves could cast and how it actually worked. &nbsp;Primal casting has often been identified as "messy" and seems more often to be the casting of attempting various options before finding something that works. &nbsp;Regardless Primal casting refers to all efferent aetherial casting prior to the common utilization of aeonized objects.</p>
<p>This leads to the question of how does one cast without four-point or aeonized object? &nbsp;Many scholars believe that the aetherial matrix behaved much differently centuries ago. &nbsp;Other scholars believe that the planar "landscape" might have differed or the makeup of the world itself effected the ability to cast. &nbsp;One way or another the aether could more easily come in contact with the material as the need for objects was not necessary.</p>
<p>Even without objects as we think about them however there were and are ways to to aeonize and begin the three step process of casting. One very dangerous, although we have historical evidence of, way was to come in contact with aether directly in small amounts prior to casting or regularly. This is not advised and leads to several physiological concerns.</p>
<p>One example of this are the Capita Magna which were primal casters from what is present Mezzomond. These people would have innates cause aetherial exhaust so that they could "burn into themselves the magic". Capita Magna were spiritual advisors and primal casters until the practice eventually died out during an Azalt invasion of the the region.</p>
<p>I'll be taking questions before I continue.</p>

  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>You mentioned that coming into contact with small amounts of aether often led to several physiological concerns. Were there any patterns among these concerns or effects that occurred more commonly than others or were these effects largely random in how they manifested?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Burns. Sickness and illness. Death.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>As Dowan suggests but more that that continuous exposure leads to other concerns. Capita Magna means big head and there is evidence that suggests long term swelling of the cranium during developmental years. Replicating this however to better understand why would be a experiment that is frowned upon.</p>
  <p>Any questions or would you like me to elaborate further?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good.</p>
  <p><strong>SaosinRed</strong></p>
  <p>So is that through repeated exposure only?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>If Capita Magna were spiritual advisors, were innate casters also given a role of that nature, or did they occupy other roles?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: If Capita Magna were spiritual advisors, were innate casters also given a role of that nature, or did they occupy other roles?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is more of a culture question and is mostly dependent on region and date.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Fair enough.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>SaosinRed: Is that through repeated exposure only?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As far as I understand.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good to keep going.</p>
  <p><strong>SaosinRed</strong></p>
  <p>I'm also good</p>
  <p><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
  <p>Also good</p>

<h3>Primal Casting</h3>
<p>Like all eras in casting however there was continuous development of the craft. &nbsp;Some of the earliest Azalt efferent casters were still considered primal and before the utilization of objects as we know them they would create large geographic areas with aeonized materials essentially creating giant 4-points they themselves would live on. &nbsp;Those who were designated efferent casters would learn about the trade from an early age would wear metal rings of aeonized material. &nbsp;It should be noted these objects were not utilized as objects but instead were used to open the material to the aetherial matrix usually without summation but with much, much larger holes than the ones we utilized today. &nbsp;This would create a large variety of instances upon casting depending on the rate of waves summating to the opening. &nbsp;This means that aether will flow in either slowly or rapidly to the area. &nbsp;Due to the limitations of knowing the amount and rate of aether provided programming was greatly limited as a concept and process.</p>
<p>These people who aggressively ripped reality to put it simply were a type of aetherial efferent casters who conducted magic that is now called "Arcane". The term Arcane now refers to all casting prior to the current era of casting back to these particular casters. It is for this reason why Arcane and Primal are often used interchangeably by those not familiar with the development of efferent casting.</p>
<p>Since there is no certainty to the rate and amount of aether Primal casting often caused large aetherial exhaust or backlash. For this reason many of these early Azalt casters would also carry and sometimes stitch into themselves lead. Of course the constant contact and inadvertent consumption also had physiological effects.</p>
<p>It would take until Classical Casting to return to the utilization of aeonized metals and an object held in hand to cast efferent aetherial magic.</p>
<p>Although they would be much smaller and programming utilized much more efficiently.</p>
<p>I'm accepting questions.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>What do you mean when you say "used to open the material to the aetherial matrix usually without summation"? I thought opening the hole was aeonization, not summation?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Or did the caster just not summate at will to force aether waves to accumulate at a draw point, and any summation was a result of natural wave behavior of the aetherial matrix?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>This might be more of a cultural question again, but is there any record of how the utility of both aeonized materials and lead were discovered or was it part of the ongoing trial and error process that seems to have defined most the the primal casting period?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong>: What do you mean when you say "used to open the material to the aetherial matrix usually without summation"? I thought opening the hole was aeonization, not summation?&nbsp;Or did the caster just not summate at will to force aether waves to accumulate at a draw point, and any summation was a result of natural wave behavior of the aetherial matrix?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The caster simply did not summate and the summation was natural.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Also, just to clarify, aeonized metals and objects simply allowed more control over the casting, yeah?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: Also, just to clarify, aeonized metals and objects simply allowed more control over the casting, yeah?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'd say they are almost necessary now but there is some exceptions. &nbsp;That however will be a lecture much later.</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>You note that "It would take until Classical Casting to return to the utilization of aeonized metals and an object held in hand to cast efferent aetherial magic" does this mean that there was a period where efferent casters stopped using aeonized objects for some reason? And if I'm properly interpreting the order of the efferent casting types you listed in the "Alternative Casting" thread in #reference, would this have been the "Discovery" era/period of efferent casting?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p>Correct, the next in this series of lectures.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: I'd say they are almost necessary now but there is some exceptions. &nbsp;That however will be a lecture much later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ah right, because for some reason nowadays, the aetherial matrix is harder to open up to material planes, yeah? So if we had one of the rings they used for Arcane casting today, they wouldn't be able to open as big of a hole as they did?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>Is there any speculation on why the nature of the aetherial matrix changed and how more modern casting might be different if it hadn't (allowing the combination of the refined techniques and easier access to the aetherial matrix)?</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Aeonization degrades so it isn't entirely clear how aeonized these rings were but we generally understand how they were utilized.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>:YuunoTea:</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ArcaneIllumination: Is there any speculation on why the nature of the aetherial matrix changed and how more modern casting might be different if it hadn't (allowing the combination of the refined techniques and easier access to the aetherial matrix)?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is a lot of speculation. &nbsp;Some believe that as aetherial efferent casting developed the utilization of the aether increased and with summation increased the number of waves. &nbsp;Others believe the increased amount of aetherial waves while creating interference would also make it easier to aeonize and so that theory has issues and instead propose that the aether is finite and we are exhausting it. &nbsp;This however would mean the rate of planes having natural overlays would increase and there is no evidence to suggest this.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you could study this with a Planar Studies researcher in the future.</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p><strong>ArcaneIllumination</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good. Though I'm realizing I'll need to go back and more closely review the previous lectures related to aetherial studies more closely.</p>
