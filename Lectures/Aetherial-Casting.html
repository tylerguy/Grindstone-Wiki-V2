<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From September 29th, 2021</i></span></p>
<h3><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>So lets get down to it.</p>
<p>Alright so aetherial casting takes a long ass time to master but lets take a moment to talk about all the steps that go into it.&nbsp; Not just the three big ones, but the little things that are happening during them and in between.&nbsp; Now something you'll find is its a field of study for a reason.&nbsp; There are limitations to our understanding of mechanisms and I'm certainly no expert on some of them, but you don't need to know how the cake bakes to make a damn good one.&nbsp; With that said we are really interested in all the little things that had to happen to make that cake so sweet in my department.&nbsp; Not actual cake, but casting of course.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>First Section - Casting Equipment</u></strong></h3>
<p>Starting from the beginning there are a few tools you'll need which are a four-point, an object, some components, and a damn good understanding of what you are doing.&nbsp; When you cast a spell it must be intended, that means spells aren't cast accidently.&nbsp; Overlays are spontaneous but programing is tough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since casting is intentional you need clear instructions for the process to complete and for something to be programmed correctly or you need to have the appropriate setup in your four-point.&nbsp; The Four-Point is a book, I prefer leather bound, that has four corners covered in an ornate blue metal.&nbsp; This material pretty easily holds and releases the aether, think of it like a super conductor for the aether.&nbsp; These corners store a good amount of aether for specific use.&nbsp; Their positionality and superconductor nature creates what we call the "weak area" which is a thin point between the plane you are on and the aetherial matrix.&nbsp; We will come back to the weak point in a moment.&nbsp; The Four-point can sometimes have an additional four corner set-up on the opposite cover.&nbsp; These double-sided four points aren't common but typically are used if one has a lot of notes and spells within their four-point or if they are a common ritual caster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inside cover of a four-point typically contains the Aetherius Simplicior which is a fancy damn chart to help you cheat a bit when you're first getting started or in a hurry. The pages are set up a little differently than a typical journal as the side margins are MUCH bigger and visible lines typically go top to bottom separating them.&nbsp; This is true through about 2/3rds of the Four-Point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many four-points have alternating parchment and then wax parchment for those who like to put their components on their cook when they cast.&nbsp; The latter third of the Four-Point is without lines and is typically where people record ritual instructions, create illustrations, or really whatever they want.&nbsp; The section between the margins of a four-point is used to actually write the spells with something called "spell-ink", real creative name.&nbsp; The ink is like typical ink but with granules of something called diamond-dust.&nbsp; If completely dry it'll really tear up your insides if inhaled.&nbsp; The stuff is commonly accepted to apt tradesmen as a universal currency but is not a very common sale item to people who don't cast spells.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>So, before we keep going, any questions?</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What kind of four-point do you like to use and why?</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>How was this originally discovered? Was the Aether manipulated BEFORE the four-point?</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>What are the different kinds of casters that you implied when you said 'common ritual casters'?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Chuck [any/all]</strong> What kind of four-point do you like to use and why?</i></p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Just the small one.&nbsp; Already have enough ways to set stuff on fire.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I'm understanding correctly, magics cannot be cast without a four-point, as this device acts as the bridge between the aether and the plane it's being called to?</p>
<p><br><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
<p>"The ink is like typical ink but with granules of something called diamond-dust." This implies that the granules aren't actually made of literal dust, if not what is it really? If it is just diamond dust, how is it grinded down? Especially in times of less technological advancement?</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Very fair</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Nyalexandra</strong> How was this originally discovered? Was the Aether manipulated BEFORE the four-point?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah but that's a history question.&nbsp; The first kind of casting we call Primal.&nbsp; The fundamental theories that assist with study help determine what "era" of magic we are casting from and really when one crosses to the other isn't well defined.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong> What are the different kinds of casters that you implied when you said 'common ritual casters'?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>There are people who do lots of rituals and people who don't.&nbsp; I'm the latter.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>That's fair!</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Sir Gruffles</strong> To make sure I'm understanding correctly, magics cannot be cast without a four-point, as this device acts as the bridge between the aether and the plane it's being called to?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily.&nbsp; There are other ways.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Amphithere Majesticon</strong> "The ink is like typical ink but with granules of something called diamond-dust." This implies that the granules aren't actually made of literal dust, if not what is it really? If it is just diamond dust, how is it grinded down? Especially in times of less technological advancement?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Never really gave the manufacturing process much thought.</p>
<p><br><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough, probably more of an engineering question after all.</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>That or you can ask Clover Company</p>
<p>Though Blue Mountain is the biggest distributor of the stuff.</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>How often do you refill your spellink?</p>
<p><br><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
<p>Oh I'll keep that in mind next time they pop up in chat then.</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Not much anymore, starting out I used it a lot.&nbsp; Also I use about three wells to rewrite my book if I need to.</p>
<p>It hasn't happened too many times but it has happened.</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Why have you needed to completely rewrite your book? Damage, or?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Fire</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Makes sense</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Don't cast thermo too close to your book.</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Have you seen anyone inscribe into metal instead, to make their spellforms more flame-resistant?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Are you asking if people used metallic four-points?</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>I've seen something like that in older magic but it's not very practical.&nbsp; Might read up on some material on that.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>You've mentioned before that with thermokinetics one can for instance fire a small stone like a bullet and leave a patch of frozen ground around them. Can the reverse also apply? Can you convert the kinetic energy of a moving object back into thermal energy to slow it down?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>You can quickly have objects stop yeah.&nbsp; You could stop an arrow in flight.&nbsp; That energy has to go somewhere though.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>ooooooo interesting</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>I know that you said that aetherial casting wasn't super well understood, but is it known that generally, what the limits are?</p>
<p>If there is any sort of limits to what one could do with aetherial casting</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>I didn't say it wasn't well understood.&nbsp; It just isn't completely understood.</p>
<p>Much like your study of physics and many studies of mechanics in chemistry or medicine.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Ahhhh I see, understandable</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>There are limits, typically by the aptitude of those casting and a few other limitations.</p>
<p>Anything else or are we ready to continue?</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>I'm ready!</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>I require more knowledge!</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>I'm ready<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Second Section - Aeonization, Summation, and Components</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Spells are classified by the rate and quantity of aether required to cast them.&nbsp; Those that require a lot of aether are dangerous and those that require a lot to be programmed fast are considered difficult and dangerous.&nbsp; We call this separation "degrees" and spells of varying degrees are only classified this way according to the minimum aether and rate needed to cast the spell.&nbsp; Things can always be enhanced.&nbsp; While there are specific and named spells that exist understand that casting is a study that has a lot of flexibility and there are infinitely many ways to use aether through the process of casting.</p>
<p>The beginning of the process requires the initial spell line.&nbsp; The amount of aether required to create the intial spell line is incredibly little and is one of the first things taught when becoming a caster.&nbsp; The minor charge of aether moves to the aeonized object and from the four-point and is directed to the weak area to create an opening, this is what we call Aeonization.</p>
<p>After Aeonization comes Summation which requires concentrated beams of an seemingly infinitesimal radii to move through long distances within the aetherial matrix to suddenly stop and amalgamate into a small charge.&nbsp; Several beams create several charges which in turn create ripples within the Aetherial Matrix like dropping several small stones into a pond but in 5-dimensions.&nbsp; These ripples come together creating wave interference which sometimes negates but other times amplifies the waves.&nbsp; This is what Summation is.&nbsp; Summation allows one to control the direction of the aether and move it towards the small hole created by the initial line as well as the rate it flows into the initial line.&nbsp; The size of the waves, direction, rate, and size of the hole all come into consideration when determining the movement of aether for a spell.</p>
<p>For many spells the use of components are necessary.&nbsp; While synthesis magic eventually hopes to make components the thing of the past it is much too complicated and impractical currently.&nbsp; Instead we use the aether for what we can and components do a lot of the heavy lifting.&nbsp; For instance, it's easier to spark oil to be set aflame than to create fire in space, although people like me can do that.&nbsp; In that case, oil is a component.&nbsp; Don't put oil on your book though, tip from me.&nbsp; The whole process does require a start and end determined by the spell lines.&nbsp; Nearly every spell used now in days has the same initializing sequence and same termination sequence much like software needs in your world.&nbsp; All the stuff in between is your programming to get to your desired goal, BOOM.</p>
<p>This has been a real brief overview of things however.&nbsp; There is lots of math and theory like up-theory.&nbsp; Multiple lectures.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>More questions?</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What are some of the named spells that are first taught, or can be considered the most simple to cast?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Delay mechanism is a simple one.&nbsp; Also Magpie's Magical Motivator.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Those sound like spells to me</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What do they do?</p>
<p><br><strong>Tyler [He/Him]</strong></p>
<p>What is Magpie's Magical Motivator?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>The former causes an object to freeze in space that is very small for a short amount of time.</p>
<p>The latter throws shit at you.</p>
<p><br><strong>Tyler [He/Him]</strong></p>
<p>that's pretty cool</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Nice</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>It...motivates you</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>I love it</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>That sounds hilarious, I can imagine fights would break out with the magical motivator spell</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>It has it's uses.</p>
<p>Though no one water walks.</p>
<p>Too dangerous.</p>
<p>Water walking is more "make water like glass" the spell.</p>
<p>But only for you.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Ah I see</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Rain becomes lethal for instance.</p>
<p>But only for you...</p>
<p>Waves become sharp blades.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong> Rain becomes lethal for instance.</i></p>
<p><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Does an umbrella alleviate this?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>But only for you</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What if you drank water?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>I don't even want to think of it.</p>
<p><br><strong>Tyler [He/Him]</strong></p>
<p>Fair</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Very fair neither do I</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Nyalexandra</strong> Does an umbrella alleviate this?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Not interested in trying</p>
<p>Fire is safer</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>What is the process that allows a person to exert their will and make aether do everything in the process of casting? Is it a mental aspect or something else?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Not interested in trying</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Seems strange that rain would be lethal... painful certainly. But the terminal velocity is still the same, and all mechanics should be similar...</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong> What is the process that allows a person to exert their will and make aether do everything in the process of casting? Is it a mental aspect or something else?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Hooo boy....</p>
<p>I'm not certain what is and isn't classified here for reasons with military R&amp;D not to mention there is a lot to say here.&nbsp; At some point though you'll hear the delightful "fuck if I know" as we go down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p><br><strong>@Nyalexandra</strong> Seems strange that rain would be lethal... painful certainly. But the terminal velocity is still the same, and all mechanics should be similar...</p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>I dunno, I don't cast it and no one I know anymore does.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Lovely! xD</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>What would some of the common components in Healing magic casting be?</p>
<p><br><strong>Nyalexandra</strong></p>
<p>Ah yes, Healing. I suppose you don't rely on mundane medical practices as we do?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, the rum was crying.&nbsp; It needed me.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>I feel that</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Sir Gruffles</strong> What would some of the common components in Healing magic casting be?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Fats, meat, sugar, the good stuff</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>makes sense</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes rum...</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>But then we'd be out of rum faster...</p>
<p>Can't have that now.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What kinds of components are used for thermokinetics? Generic flammable stuff?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Nyalexandra</strong> Ah yes, Healing. I suppose you don't rely on mundane medical practices as we do?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn't call aetherial healing a healing practice necessarily.</p>
<p>It's got it's uses though</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Sir Gruffles</strong> But then we'd be out of rum faster...</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>The casters move to rumshore</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>There's a shore of rum?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>There's a place in the loop that certainly good at making it here in Belthas.</p>
<p>I mean, it's in the name.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Sounds wonderful</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>That sounds fun</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like a sight to see xD</p>
<p>And drink I suppose</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>How hard compared to other schools of magic is translocation? Are there any simple spells that utilise it?</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>(pls tell me you can translocate beers from storage into hand)</p>
<p><br><strong>Emrys [They/Him]</strong></p>
<p>accio beer</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>There are first degree spells but translocation isn't as dramatic as you'd think.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Do you have like. Translocation pads that pop you from one place to another without you having to cast it yourself?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Do you have like. Translocation pads that pop you from one place to another without you having to cast it yourself?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Sounds like one very complicated construct.</p>
<p>Theoretically it can be done though.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Theoretically</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>One of you try /j</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Get an engineer on it</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>SHHH. You guys shut up.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Are there constructs that are basically like pre-casted spells used for later activation?</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>You both know Pauchik is the one they make build stuff...</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong> Are there constructs that are basically like pre-casted spells used for later activation?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>You're talking about contingency casting.</p>
<p>It does exist, necessary for scrolls to exist but again, complicated.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>That sounds cool! good to know</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>I thought about becoming an expert in it.&nbsp; I didn't really have the patience.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Understandable</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What other fields of casting are there beyond the major schools?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>It is applicable to all schools but it requires a background in programming.</p>
<p>You have the schools and then you have ways of application that are universal to the schools.&nbsp; Then beyond that there are specialists, people with specific jobs, that use the craft for a purpose.</p>
<p>Like Wake Necromancers.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>What are Wake Necromancers?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>They generally exist to help you say goodbye to loved ones.</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>I see</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Awwwww that's nice</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>It requires some educated guessing on the programing.&nbsp; Typically after talking to the loved ones.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Nothing from me</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Can you make a construct out of about anything?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>You guys got a special email going out so thing'll get a bit busy here soon I'm sure</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>I don't have any further questions at the moment!</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Can you make a construct out of about anything?</i></p>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Technically but the material should not decay quickly.&nbsp; Upkeep is required sometimes.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Next Topic Discussion + Extra Questions</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Any recommendations for the next lecture?</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>What if you made a construct out of water, that cast water walking on people it was fighting against. :0</p>
<p>Also do I get extra points on my exam for helping your military R&amp;D like this.</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>ADJUTANTs could you put up a poll with the remaining departments that haven't had a lecture to vote on the next two?</p>
<p><br><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Probably something about draws and historical uses of the different school of magic?</p>
<p>The latter might be a culture question though</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Fluids are a bit tough but that sounds like a side project now.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>I'm a helper.</p>
<p>So the next lecture is either engineering or alchemy?</p>
<p><br><strong>ElhamSchreiber</strong></p>
<p>Or Planar or Necromancy.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
