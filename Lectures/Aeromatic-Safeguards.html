<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello everyone I'm Gillie Mason Research Assistant II and I've never formally acted as a lecturer. As Emrys said I will be going over the topic "Iatrochemical Analysis of Aeromatic Safeguards: A Medical Discussion" With the interplay of the divine we accept the importance of both the examination of the temporal and material world as well as the divine's place in it. These observations are necessary even in the very Toristic study of Alchemy. Before I go much further it is important for me to note that the aetherial is utilized in the study of alchemy and in fact there is an entire sub-specialty with a large focus on how the aetherial might directly effect alchemical compounds. Beyond this there is even constructs that have been created to assist in the study of alchemy. This lecture however will have very little consideration for aetherial studies.</p>
<p>A fair starting point I believe is discussing the study of Iatrochemistry. Iatrochemistry is an alchemical concentration developed more than a century ago and contains the dominant alchemical principals for medical practice today. As our understanding of physiology advanced over the years the ideas in iatrochemistry with it's targeted approaches took the center stage from the idea of miracle cures. It is my hope this interval as a Iatrochemical Botanist to discuss the use of strong aeromatics to help diffuse miasma for health and safety.</p>

  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>I'm taking questions</p>
  <p><strong>Chuck</strong></p>
  <p>Are there any notable aeromatics in popular use and what are they used for?</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Is miasma meaning an unhealthy smell/atmosphere? or is there a different definition for your plane</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, something I had planned to discuss. &nbsp;Mint has become synonymous with health. &nbsp;Many physicians can be recognized by mint in their hats, on their clothes, or carrying mint. &nbsp;There is a very bitter foodstuff that people have learned to sweeten called mint cake which is consumed in the house of the sick or those who are near bad air.</p>
  <p>There are a large number of similarities between our miasma and yours. &nbsp;There is an imbalance in alchemical properties in the air usually power, abberant, or death that cause foul smells that cause imbalance in the physiology of those near it. &nbsp;Treatment requires the extraction of fluids or the use of compounds. &nbsp;These compounds have various classifications such as genesis compounds, cryotics, and many others.</p>
  <p>Application of dermal treatments is usually done when the compound is "heavy". &nbsp;The quickest mode of application is through aeromatics.</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>huh the alchemical properties in air is intriguing</p>
  <p>what are the alchemical properties? and what causes imbalance</p>
  <p>like how can power affect the air?</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>According to the wheel, which is imperfect and is most used as a best guess model, there are eight alchemical properties. &nbsp;These properties are in alignment with observed natural phenomena and concepts in religious study. &nbsp;The observation is Toristic and empirical but the logic often also follows a form of symbolic logic with results having reasonable accuracy. &nbsp;The alchemical properties are Fire, Earth, Air, Water, Life, Death, Abberant, and Power with another characteristic called volatility which differs from your concept of it. &nbsp;The wheel helps better understand product volatility in an experiment with a scale for each alchemical property being compared against eachother. &nbsp;The spaces between the alchemical characteristics on the wheel suggest higher volatility when combined. &nbsp;Recently however there has been a proposed model that better explains some experimental results but fails in some predictions by the wheel that suggest 23 separate characteristics with a very complex interaction chart.</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh wow that seems quite complicated</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>The material properties are also of great importance to us. &nbsp;Recently a construct was developed that suggests a direct relation to occupied space for some compounds and its observed properties. &nbsp;Needless to say there is a lot we still don't understand.</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p>Then I'll proceed.</p>

<h3>Aeromatics</h3>
<p>Aeromatics are exactly what one would suspect. Alchemical compounds that freely present in the air without visible volatility and contain a strong smell. The perception of these scents seem to differ from certain species and so it is suggested that they directly effect the physiology of species differently. Aeromatics of stronger scent are believed to be larger in size and have more area to buffer other scents. They also aggregate with one another. It is for this reason that one can still become ill when around the diseased air even in the presence of excess medicinal aeromatics for their safety. The likelihood of imbalance is simply decreased.</p>
<p>Medicinal aeromatics are large aeromatics that have little effect on one's physiology making it difficult to create an imbalance. This typically only happens in very large quantities leading to the resulting theory that anything in the right amount can cause an imbalance. This is a theory of virtue health.</p>

  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>I'm now taking more questions</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>You mentioned being a latrochemical biologist. Are there other careers in latrochemistry?</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely, Iatrochemists work primarily in medicine but there are different studies within Iatrochemistry on how the medicinal compounds work.</p>
  <p><strong>Future Ghost</strong></p>
  <p>What would you describe as the biggest difference between miasma and chemical pollution?</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>I would say they are mostly similar. &nbsp;The imbalance causes the pathology. &nbsp;The primary difference is pollution lacks specificity.</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p>This being my first lecture I suppose I could continue to elaborate on ideas of crowding and compound size but I believe my topic is not a great one to elaborate on with a lot more background. &nbsp;I'm happy to discuss most topics on Alchemy though</p>
  <p>I know I'm not here much.</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>please elaborate on virtue health</p>
  <p><strong>GillieMason</strong></p>
  <p>Imagine a sliding scale. &nbsp;The values within the sliding scale have a singular range of virtue and the other ends vice. &nbsp;Virtue may be the values 2 to 6 for one person and one identified need while virtue might be only 7 for another need or the same need with another person. &nbsp;Those needs could be anything from food to blood. &nbsp;In observance of virtue health from the prospective of those utilizing the wheel we might say there is a standard value of different alchemical properties for different parts of your body. &nbsp;Through ingestion or particular compounds, the presence of protective aeromatics, bleeding, or other means we hope to regulate parts of your body to be in virtue.</p>
  <p>Someone might have visceral blood for instance in excess or without enough or their blood might have too much of a particular alchemical characteristic or too little.</p>
