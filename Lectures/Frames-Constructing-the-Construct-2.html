<h6>PSA</h6>
<p>I do have a few things I's like to address before we jump back into things.</p>
<p>Alright, before we jump into the lecture again just a small PSA about internet safety. Remember not to click any weird links from people and if something is too good to be true then, you know, it probably is. Also if any of you experienced something particularly weird from interacting with the MC server or after interacting with the MC server please DM me about what you experienced.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>did you mean to say "remeber not to click any links from weird people"</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I did</p>
  <p>Good catch</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>how about weird links from weird people, best of both worlds &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Am I considered a weird people :0</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>lol</p>
  <p>if link is weird or people is weird</p>
  <p>no clicky</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>If it's the familiar weird then sure but if it is someone you don't know then best not.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh yeah that reminds me does the big blue doll tree weird have an official name</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Probably, I'd have to check reference on that though.</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what about downloading and running a .exe file acquired through dubious means? ü§î asking for my friends @Thyme and @Emrys &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I'd say .exe is sus... &nbsp;Did you guys actually download and run them?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yes they did</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe move that discussion to my DMs</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>idk what you mean üò≥</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ohhh i</p>
  <p>mm</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Uhoh</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i downloaded it too</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Why is everyone so excited to like download evil and strange files xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>because</p>
  <p>must clikcy</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>its like why you always click the spoilers</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>damn</p>
  <p>got me there</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Don't you have security or something telling you not to do stuff like that?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>where can I find this exe file I wanna look at the code that makes it</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>uhhhhhh]</p>
  <p>ive got it do you want it</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have an antivirus?</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i may have turned mine partically off bcs it kept shouting at me for nothing</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>cuz I do xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>i have one</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>good</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>and every antivirus ive tried is literally just a virus in disguise</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>but i ingnored it when it said the file was sus</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>bruv</p>
  <p><strong>infin</strong></p>
  <p>i can dm it to you if you want but uh.. glances at james..</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean</p>
  <p>sure DM it to me xD</p>
  <p>I wanna look at them CODES</p>
  <p>:rooAwwSlam:</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>its in game-talk still i think</p>
  <p><strong>infin</strong></p>
  <p>yeah thats where i pulled it from</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Let's not share strange .exe files if we can.</p>
  <p>Just a friendly request</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>that's probably a smart request, my apologies researcher tischler</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Fineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</p>
  <p>I won't look at the evil weird files from the weird entity that was probably on the Minecraft server</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>we never decoded the message anyways</p>
  <p>:((</p>
  <p><strong>infin</strong></p>
  <p>oh you're right damn i need to look into that again</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>or....orrrrrr &nbsp;just going with this. &nbsp;We leave it alone.</p>
  <p>emerald &nbsp;</p>
  <p>lol ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>And then you tell me in detail over DMs what happened.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>sure</p>
  <p>i wasn't there for the whole thing but some of it</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i'll write up a recap to the best of my ability and send it your way</p>
  <p>if you do decrypt the string tell me what it says tho /j</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>all i can think of is base 64 so idk</p>
  <p>ok can you expand on the command pulse?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>soo... &nbsp;Any other questions while we got like 30 minutes?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>can you talk about the command pulse</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>have you been working on anything cool lately?</p>
  <p>also what is the pinnacle of Necromancy, like the best possible creation?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>How are you doing today??? :0</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What exactly do you want to know?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Theoretically or in practice?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i guess definition, how it works</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Being confined by a foot of snow outside.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ewww</p>
  <p>Yeah I figured</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>hoping for snow tomorrow but itll probably be sleet</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I hope that otherwise your doing alright D:</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>both if you could?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>If a construct could be created that is fully self regulating or simply doesn't degrade and could use heuristics as a full frame I would say that they could be indistinguishable from programmers. &nbsp;That I believe would be about what we could hope to do</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The Abbots are pretty pinnacle. :y_duckiesip: &nbsp;</p>
  <p>They aren't uh... all that stuff James just said. But they're a very bold step.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what are those</p>
  <p><strong>Map &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do your constructs follow the law of conservation of mass?</p>
  <p><strong>Th</strong><i><strong>eAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Are there legal regulations for programmers to follow when making constructs? Just out of curiosity</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Security</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>An exe can not do any harm to a computer</p>
  <p>Assuming you don‚Äôt give it any permissions</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The natural law is pretty consistent, enough it may be Belthidian.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then you underestimate the power of exe files xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, UMAD controls the distribution of Necromancy Licenses. &nbsp;There are several rules and regulations in regard to them.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>This is a channel for lecture questions, as a reminder.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Is there anything similar to our ‚Äúthree laws of robotics‚Äù that we have on EXT-918. If your familiar?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I believe this was asked before. &nbsp;The short answer is not quite.</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Have you considered using electricity to construct auxiliary‚Ä¶ somethings? Things that function like constructs but just electricity. So that they don‚Äôt create aether interference with other parts of the construct.</p>
  <p>Like the Dormitschler or whatever it was, that allowed Aetherial regulation or something by receiving signals from Aether waves to modify construct Aether waves accordingly. Maybe if it was electrical somehow?</p>
  <p>Or some other mechanism that doesn‚Äôt cause interference.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>right, doesn't electricity not work the same way in pm1</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe? I think I recall that being mentioned.</p>
  <p>Which interests me from a biological perspective, how would neural stimulation work???</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>it may have been internal üëÄ</p>
  <p>ooh</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The study of electricity is of interest to some departments but you'll find we are far behind in the study from where you are.</p>
  <p><strong>Name&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Has the possibility of its use as an auxiliary structure come up in programming constructs before though? Like mentioned or something?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>do electrical devices from our plane work on yours</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Unfortunately I cannot discuss this in an external chat.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p>waht is your most favorite project you've worked on</p>
  <p>and how did you get started in umad?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>After these two questions I'm going to move back to lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Yay lecture!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah we got like half the lecture finished last time</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I think the most meaningful project I've worked on so far has been PG but I study communication technology primarily. &nbsp;I've been working with illusion specialists on a personal project for some time. &nbsp;I cannot elaborate at this time however.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ooo</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>As for how I got started in UMAD, I needed work after the revolution. &nbsp;I came to Dial in the tower's second year of construction. &nbsp;I'm originally from a place that is widely royalist so it wasn't like I could go home and look for work after the revolution.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I primarily worked on creating an advantage through aetherial mechanisms. &nbsp;The need for them was impractical however so I began creating faulty mechanisms intended to force backlash with little aeonization.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what were those used fo?</p>
  <p>like grenades or something?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Something like that... &nbsp;Faulty items were discovered by enemy troops but my signature was obvious so other loyalists who were aeonization experts would seek them out of a crowd and cause them to blow. &nbsp;I spent the better part of the revolution however away from any engagement but even then you saw how it affected the local communities.</p>
  <p>There was so much paranoia and I know that was mostly due to the loyalists. &nbsp;We had to do many things that we aren't proud of.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What was your signature?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You'll learn this in aetherial studies but a signature is inevitable. &nbsp;People create their own shortcuts and techniques to casting so aetherial efferent casters are said to have a signature. &nbsp;There are experts who study these for law enforcement. &nbsp;Signatures are like a caster's finger prints while aetherial marks are like a brand that is intentional.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>:0</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Alright, lecture</p>
