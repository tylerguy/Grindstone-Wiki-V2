<h6>PSA</h6>
<p>I do have a few things I's like to address before we jump back into things.</p>
<p>Alright, before we jump into the lecture again just a small PSA about internet safety. Remember not to click any weird links from people and if something is too good to be true then, you know, it probably is. Also if any of you experienced something particularly weird from interacting with the MC server or after interacting with the MC server please DM me about what you experienced.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>did you mean to say "remeber not to click any links from weird people"</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I did</p>
  <p>Good catch</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>how about weird links from weird people, best of both worlds &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Am I considered a weird people :0</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>lol</p>
  <p>if link is weird or people is weird</p>
  <p>no clicky</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>If it's the familiar weird then sure but if it is someone you don't know then best not.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh yeah that reminds me does the big blue doll tree weird have an official name</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Probably, I'd have to check reference on that though.</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what about downloading and running a .exe file acquired through dubious means? ü§î asking for my friends @Thyme and @Emrys &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I'd say .exe is sus... &nbsp;Did you guys actually download and run them?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yes they did</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe move that discussion to my DMs</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>idk what you mean üò≥</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ohhh i</p>
  <p>mm</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Uhoh</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i downloaded it too</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Why is everyone so excited to like download evil and strange files xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>because</p>
  <p>must clikcy</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>its like why you always click the spoilers</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>damn</p>
  <p>got me there</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Don't you have security or something telling you not to do stuff like that?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>where can I find this exe file I wanna look at the code that makes it</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>uhhhhhh]</p>
  <p>ive got it do you want it</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have an antivirus?</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i may have turned mine partically off bcs it kept shouting at me for nothing</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>cuz I do xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>i have one</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>good</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>and every antivirus ive tried is literally just a virus in disguise</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>but i ingnored it when it said the file was sus</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>bruv</p>
  <p><strong>infin @TheAutumnWriter </strong>(<s>where can I find this exe file I wanna look at the code that makes it)</s></p>
  <p>i can dm it to you if you want but uh.. glances at james..</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean</p>
  <p>sure DM it to me xD</p>
  <p>I wanna look at them CODES</p>
  <p>:rooAwwSlam:</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>its in game-talk still i think</p>
  <p><strong>infin @Emrys </strong>(its in game-talk still i think)</p>
  <p>yeah thats where i pulled it from</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Let's not share strange .exe files if we can.</p>
  <p>Just a friendly request</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>that's probably a smart request, my apologies researcher tischler</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Fineeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</p>
  <p>I won't look at the evil weird files from the weird entity that was probably on the Minecraft server</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>we never decoded the message anyways</p>
  <p>:((</p>
  <p><strong>infin</strong></p>
  <p>oh you're right damn i need to look into that again</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>or....orrrrrr &nbsp;just going with this. &nbsp;We leave it alone.</p>
  <p>emerald &nbsp;</p>
  <p>lol ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>And then you tell me in detail over DMs what happened.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>sure</p>
  <p>i wasn't there for the whole thing but some of it</p>
  <p><strong>infin&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i'll write up a recap to the best of my ability and send it your way</p>
  <p>if you do decrypt the string tell me what it says tho /j</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>all i can think of is base 64 so idk</p>
  <p>ok can you expand on the command pulse?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>soo... &nbsp;Any other questions while we got like 30 minutes?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>can you talk about the command pulse</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>have you been working on anything cool lately?</p>
  <p>also what is the pinnacle of Necromancy, like the best possible creation?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>How are you doing today??? :0</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What exactly do you want to know?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Emrys </strong>(also what is the pinnacle of Necromancy, like the best possible creation?)</p>
  <p>Theoretically or in practice?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i guess definition, how it works</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter </strong>(How are you doing today??? :0)</p>
  <p>Being confined by a foot of snow outside.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ewww</p>
  <p>Yeah I figured</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>hoping for snow tomorrow but itll probably be sleet</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I hope that otherwise your doing alright D:</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys @JamesTischler </strong>(Theoretically or in practice?)</p>
  <p>both if you could?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>If a construct could be created that is fully self regulating or simply doesn't degrade and could use heuristics as a full frame I would say that they could be indistinguishable from programmers. &nbsp;That I believe would be about what we could hope to do</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The Abbots are pretty pinnacle. :y_duckiesip: &nbsp;</p>
  <p>They aren't uh... all that stuff James just said. But they're a very bold step.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what are those</p>
  <p><strong>Map &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do your constructs follow the law of conservation of mass?</p>
  <p><strong>Th</strong><i><strong>eAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Are there legal regulations for programmers to follow when making constructs? Just out of curiosity</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Security</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>An exe can not do any harm to a computer</p>
  <p>Assuming you don‚Äôt give it any permissions</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The natural law is pretty consistent, enough it may be Belthidian.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter&nbsp;@Thyme </strong>(An exe can not do any harm to a computer)</p>
  <p>Then you underestimate the power of exe files xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter </strong>(Are there legal regulations for programmers to follow when making constructs? Just out of curiosity)</p>
  <p>Yes, UMAD controls the distribution of Necromancy Licenses. &nbsp;There are several rules and regulations in regard to them.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>This is a channel for lecture questions, as a reminder.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter @JamesTischler </strong>(Yes, UMAD controls the distribution of Necromancy Licenses. There are several rules and regulations in regard to them.)</p>
  <p>Is there anything similar to our ‚Äúthree laws of robotics‚Äù that we have on EXT-918. If your familiar?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I believe this was asked before. &nbsp;The short answer is not quite.</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Have you considered using electricity to construct auxiliary‚Ä¶ somethings? Things that function like constructs but just electricity. So that they don‚Äôt create aether interference with other parts of the construct.</p>
  <p>Like the Dormitschler or whatever it was, that allowed Aetherial regulation or something by receiving signals from Aether waves to modify construct Aether waves accordingly. Maybe if it was electrical somehow?</p>
  <p>Or some other mechanism that doesn‚Äôt cause interference.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>right, doesn't electricity not work the same way in pm1</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Maybe? I think I recall that being mentioned.</p>
  <p>Which interests me from a biological perspective, how would neural stimulation work???</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>it may have been internal üëÄ</p>
  <p>ooh</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The study of electricity is of interest to some departments but you'll find we are far behind in the study from where you are.</p>
  <p><strong>Name&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Has the possibility of its use as an auxiliary structure come up in programming constructs before though? Like mentioned or something?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>do electrical devices from our plane work on yours</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;@emerald </strong>(do electrical devices from our plane work on yours)</p>
  <p>Unfortunately I cannot discuss this in an external chat.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p>waht is your most favorite project you've worked on</p>
  <p>and how did you get started in umad?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>After these two questions I'm going to move back to lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Yay lecture!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah we got like half the lecture finished last time</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I think the most meaningful project I've worked on so far has been PG but I study communication technology primarily. &nbsp;I've been working with illusion specialists on a personal project for some time. &nbsp;I cannot elaborate at this time however.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>ooo</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>As for how I got started in UMAD, I needed work after the revolution. &nbsp;I came to Dial in the tower's second year of construction. &nbsp;I'm originally from a place that is widely royalist so it wasn't like I could go home and look for work after the revolution.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I primarily worked on creating an advantage through aetherial mechanisms. &nbsp;The need for them was impractical however so I began creating faulty mechanisms intended to force backlash with little aeonization.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what were those used fo?</p>
  <p>like grenades or something?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Something like that... &nbsp;Faulty items were discovered by enemy troops but my signature was obvious so other loyalists who were aeonization experts would seek them out of a crowd and cause them to blow. &nbsp;I spent the better part of the revolution however away from any engagement but even then you saw how it affected the local communities.</p>
  <p>There was so much paranoia and I know that was mostly due to the loyalists. &nbsp;We had to do many things that we aren't proud of.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What was your signature?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You'll learn this in aetherial studies but a signature is inevitable. &nbsp;People create their own shortcuts and techniques to casting so aetherial efferent casters are said to have a signature. &nbsp;There are experts who study these for law enforcement. &nbsp;Signatures are like a caster's finger prints while aetherial marks are like a brand that is intentional.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>:0</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Alright, lecture</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>Yay</p>
  <p><strong>Iron</strong></p>
  <p>Showtime.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ohh ok I though signatures and marks were the same</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>You can use a mark as a signature, like signing something but when I say signature here I mean that fingerprint created when casting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6>Frames</h6>
<p>Getting back into things I just had to refresh myself as to where we left off. It's time to talk more about frames.</p>
<p>What does a frame look like? To be honest it doesn't "look" like anything without some assistance but typically is seems like lines that support the structure like a wire skeleton of the construct in question. The frame can exist outside of the material body of the construct but it is highly recommended against as it could run into a material that could erase it such as lead. While not entirely necessary it is common practice to link all lines to create a full frame as it is often simply more practical but for full frames that need to be created quickly often multiple programmers will work to create segments of the total construct before linking them and making certain that the programming works together synergistically. The largest of constructs have used very large teams but with large numbers of people there is frequent errors in communication with the segments and often people will need to go through and repair degradation as the construct is built. This means giant wartime constructs aren't really practical though if you see a large full frame it is mostly to intimidate.</p>
<p>For this portion of talking about the building of the frame I'll try to guage your understanding and then build from there.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Please tell me how you understand the frame to be created from the smaller working parts up to the walking aetherial skeleton.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So from Pauchik‚Äôs lectures, seems like we have aeonization to open holes to Aetherial matrix, and we have directed line segments of spells (Aether waves). They have rate of Aether, directionality which is the direction of lines, and intensity which I guess is self explanatory. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>What I‚Äôm particularly iffy on is, so spells are literally just directed Aether waves confined to what seems like a 1D space?</p>
  <p>With rate/frequency, directionality/orientation, and intensity/amplitude.</p>
  <p>And a bit of speculation on my part, perhaps aether waves going from one segment to another segment might not do so perfectly? So maybe what spells follow what would be somewhat important, depending on the configurations of Aether wave each spell requires.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>One thing aetherial has not yet addressed with you is the instructions of a spell and how we get from aetherial waves to a freaking ball of fire or something.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>fireballlllllllllllllllllllllll</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh dear will we finally learn to program?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>In programming, in this case the school of magic, systems of spells are created with routes of activation following simple concepts in logic.</p>
  <p>I found my learning EXT-918 programming has been fairly easy with my understanding of our programming.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>good to know!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The idea of creating a construct is an expansion of the idea of leaving a spell not complete and able to be cast without the interaction of the caster.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>And do it repeatedly? Like return to an incomplete state then complete state and repeat.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Are we trying to explain how frames are made?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>He‚Äôs trying to gauge our understanding on it, yeah.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>So you cast spells and somehow string them toegther in a line, I think</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Something like that, yes. &nbsp;Imagine if you created an aetherial spell meant to assist with the summation process but the spell hadn't actually be cast yet. &nbsp;Instead that spell is cast only upon that which is inhibiting it to be cast is removed but that only happens when another spell completes. &nbsp;This spell might have multiple paths it could take due to slight change in directions and these changes could be determined by other spells that may change due to other variables.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Uhh let me look back at the notes</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That seems pretty similar to the concepts that were taught in the little programming classes that I was in ü§î</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So you can think of it as removing seals to casting the desired spell? Like if segment A inhibits segment B‚Äôs ability to cast spell C. We remove A, let B cast C, then put A back, then remove again, and so forth?</p>
  <p>Addendum: Not sure if I‚Äôm using terms right. Maybe better to say deactivate A or something? &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Do the spells create the lines? Or how are the lines created?</p>
  <p>Is it like ‚Äúwhen this button is pressed, do this‚Äù</p>
  <p>Ok so the lines have segments, each segment is like a one of code, it does a simple thing</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(Do the spells create the lines? Or how are the lines created?)</p>
  <p>A line is a large number of incomplete and complete spells in 3 dimensional space.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Interesting that you remove inhibitors instead of adding necessary components</p>
  <p>This might be out of our depth right now but since you have logical operators, are there ways to loop as well?</p>
  <p>For or while loop for example</p>
  <p>We‚Äôre going over these in compsci class rn</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Spell A says use thermokinetics to lift object A and move X/Y/Z distance but upon cast also makes Spell B cast which says to begin summation which activates Spell C to summate while Spell D casts Spell A but in an incomplete form that is completed when Spell E completes but only because of variables determined through utilizing Spell F,G, and H... &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald</strong> (This might be out of our depth right now but since you have logical operators, are there ways to loop as well?)</p>
  <p>Yes, the loop is very important to keep spells casting to maintain the lines.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh dear.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Are there ways to store values or check if a condition is fulfilled</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>This is why we build up on the concept instead of jumping into programming a construct immediately.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>How many spells do beginner constructs have</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(Are there ways to store values or check if a condition is fulfilled)</p>
  <p>There is. &nbsp;This requires, you guessed it, more lines of spells.</p>
  <p>The first construct I made while I was learning was a very small 24 spell repeating construct.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Bruh</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>sounds like fun xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>So once a spell is cast, can it go back to being unfasten</p>
  <p>Not unfasten, uncast</p>
  <p>Would that just be stopping summation?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>No, a spell moves to completion so you need a spell that in turn casts a spell. &nbsp;Though if you summate aether and don't finish instructions then the aether expands rapidly outward with great force. &nbsp;That is backlash.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>Oof</p>
  <p>But if a spell casts a spell, it will only be ale to made one spell happen?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So would the absolute simplest construct be, spell A does thermokinetics or something to object A to move X/Y/Z, but also casts spell B completely, which casts spell A completely? Or would that like, blow up in my face?</p>
  <p>Oh, probably need three spells because geometry.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Not quite. &nbsp;You can have one spell cast that triggers two or more spells in sequence.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Makes sense</p>
  <p>Can one spell trigger a spell, wait a period of time, then cast another</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Do spells that cast each other need to be segments that are joined together at some vertex?</p>
  <p>Or not necessarily?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(So would the absolute simplest construct be, spell A does thermokinetics or something to object A to move X/Y/Z, but also casts spell B‚Ä¶)</p>
  <p>In that situation it would terminate after the second casting.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Or wait to cast a second spell on a condition</p>
  <p><strong>Name @JamesTischler </strong>(In that situation it would terminate after the second casting.)</p>
  <p>Is it because the object is gone?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>A spell that casts a spell is the idea behind contingency magic.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(Is it because the object is gone?)</p>
  <p>The frame would have terminated but the object would remain in that instance.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(Do spells that cast each other need to be segments that are joined together at some vertex?)</p>
  <p>Yes and no. &nbsp;It is easier when getting up to the tune of hundreds of joined spells.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(Can one spell trigger a spell, wait a period of time, then cast another)</p>
  <p>The delay can be created within the spell instructions or through a longer series of spells.</p>
  <p>One is more practical over the other depending on what you are doing.</p>
  <p>CSCs for instance may have the delay within their own instructions.</p>
  <p><strong>Name @JamesTischler </strong>(The frame would have terminated but the object would remain in that instance.)</p>
  <p>So wait, then why would the construct terminate after se- wait, does it terminate because if spell A and spell B are cast completely, that‚Äôs it? The spells are done permanently?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>You can always tell a programmer's 4-point. &nbsp;They are pretty dense</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>No wait. Hm.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Spell A makes Object A move but Starts Spell B which completes and casts A</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Yeah.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>This means Spell A is cast twice but there is no Spell B after it is cast its first time.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Are single contingent casters constructs</p>
  <p>Also I'm off to dinner, I'll be back soon hooefuly</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>CSCs are contingent spells which some would argue semantically isn't a construct but is the basis for creating constructs.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Hm. So there is no more Spell B, but if Spell A is completed and cast a second time, shouldn‚Äôt it complete and cast Spell B again? So Spell B‚Äôs back in the picture? &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>There are a few ways you can loop this. &nbsp;Spell A can be the contingency for another spell but in being cast is does not cast Spell B, it casts the thermokinetics spell.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So relegate Spell A to solely do thermokinetics, but there exists a Spell C that‚Äôs all like ‚ÄúIf Spell A does its thing, let‚Äôs do Spell B‚Äù, then Spell B happens and casts/completes Spell A I think, and repeat process?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Correct and you can create loops with multiple spells to cycle and recast. &nbsp;These processes can get very elaborate however.</p>
  <p>That's why we invent shortcuts. &nbsp;You can think of the people in necro as logic specialists in a way while your department is bigger on analytics.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Okay. And it isn‚Äôt possible to do this but with only two spells without it terminating? Like you can‚Äôt have A be the contingency for B which does A again?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>I‚Äôm back</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Casting a spell A to cast spell B when B is a complete spell and not a spell that is partially incomplete would just be a very lengthy way to Cast B. &nbsp;When you use contingencies you are using incomplete spells that are triggered by a variable at a certain point in sequence.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Can the physical part of a frame trigger a spell?</p>
  <p>Like if I were to flick a switch</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>With the assistance of the illusion school we have found ways outside of being a caster to initiate a program to activate a sequence of spells by mechanical manipulation, yes.</p>
  <p>These are just...yet another complicated addition to a construct.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Hmm</p>
  <p>So many spells‚Ä¶</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(Okay. And it <i>isn‚Äôt</i> possible to do this but with only two spells without it terminating? Like you can‚Äôt have A be the contingency for B which does A again?)</p>
  <p>I hope this is helpful üòÖ I know it is complicated and I'm not a lecturer primarily.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ur doing great</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Well it certainly helps me identify where I‚Äôm lacking understanding, particularly what it means for a spell to be complete and incomplete. I think I‚Äôm starting to get a foothold.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have a paragraph typed up on thenbuilding of constructs? Like for lecture-hall</p>
  <p>I think more info on how constructs are made would be helpful</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Hm... &nbsp;Perhaps we should table what we re discussing in favor of giving Aetherial and Planar some time that way I can build off some concepts to more easily discuss the process of making a construct.</p>
  <p>I know Aetherial needs to discuss the bar test to better understand why we pick certain materials for constructs.</p>
  <p>You have 4 bars. &nbsp;A long iron, a short iron, a lead, and a quartz bar. &nbsp;It's one of the first "labs" you conduct in your learning typically.</p>
  <p>I'll be here for 20 more minutes then I need to get back to my current task.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>I saw long and short iron and I thought they were golf clubs lmao</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Not my intention also, ew...golf</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>:0</p>
  <p>I play it lol</p>
  <p>Well not now it‚Äôs cold</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I went to golf school the first Summer I was on EXT-918</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Golf school??</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So what, try to make a thermokinetic construct outta the bars and see it either fail miserably or pass?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Yeah, a summer program to learn to improve your game.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Was your game improved</p>
  <p>Well I‚Äôm assuming the test shows how lead and quartz affect aetherial, not sure about the irons</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(So what, try to make a thermokinetic construct outta the bars and see it either fail miserably or pass?)</p>
  <p>It's just used to show how raw aether can move.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Ah.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a way to visualize it without training?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>You‚Äôd need something special though to see aether though, no? Or maybe you‚Äôre casting a spell into it?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Like how we might use iron dust to see magnetic fields</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name </strong>(You‚Äôd need something special though to see aether though, no? Or maybe you‚Äôre casting a spell into it?)</p>
  <p>There are spells in the aeonization school to help with this but there are also other things you can do to know where it is going.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Oh like ph indicator that would be cool too</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Next time I'll elaborate more on process then maybe we can discuss why undead are easier to program than full frames.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ooh ok</p>
  <p>there are small frames right</p>
  <p>like as a classification</p>
  <p>im not making it up in my brain?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Small frames are a type of full frame but small frames are a very advanced topic as they require an understanding of aetherial and material interactions and how to create programs in small physical space without additional interference or error.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh wow</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Egg is very good at small frame construction and I'll be honest, I ambitiously wanted to do them and that is why I am an aetherial mechanism specialist.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>like cell phon</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Moore‚Äôs Law be like.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>if only it was that fast</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White @JamesTischler </strong>(Egg is very good at small frame construction‚Ä¶)</p>
  <p>Egg cheeeeeeats though, is the thing.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>somehow i think transistors are easier to make than spells</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean it‚Äôs an exponential function, probably just in its beginning stages.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>how do they cheat?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Parallel processing.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i mean it could always be a log function that would suck</p>
  <p>what s parallel processing</p>
  <p><strong>Map &nbsp;@Researcher White </strong>(Parallel processing.)</p>
  <p>That‚Äôs just being efficient</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Parallel processing is a method in computing in which separate parts of an overall complex task are broken up and run simultaneously on multiple CPUs, thereby reducing the amount of time for processing.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Though I do wonder what your technology might look like when combined with our programming. &nbsp;Imagine functionally fitting two devices in the same physical space.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok its just ext 918 definition</p>
  <p>oh man it would be awesome</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps one day I'll have more time to examine it.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I was using the ext 918 definition, yes.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>They already do this man...</p>
  <p>They have like, swiss army knives and stuff.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>right but not magic swiss amy knives</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Give James time.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>As soon as summated aether becomes anything more than a bad time on this plane...</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>So like, confine our technology in the shape of spell lines? Or use them and our natural laws to replicate technological functions with spell lines?</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>But yeah, Egg is kind of unfair to compare yourself to when it comes to programming because they've got that whole thing going on.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Oh! &nbsp;I had forgot to mention. &nbsp;Another department member will be joining us soon.</p>
  <p>Well... &nbsp;They have been assigned to PG and are undergoing training at the moment.</p>
  <p>Planar is also getting one</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>So we‚Äôre getting a Planar member and a member of a different department? Are we allowed to know what other department?</p>
  <p><strong>Map &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>niceee</p>
  <p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Necromancy</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That's what I meant to say.</p>
  <p>Treat em well. &nbsp;They will also have voice access.</p>
  <p>I hope you all enjoyed yourselves.</p>
  <p>Aaaaand.... smoke bomb</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>See ya, James! Good luck with your tasks!</p>
  <p><strong>butter&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>bye bye James! thanks for the lecture!!</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>MY ASTHMAAAAAAA D:</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yayy</p>
  <p>thanks for lecture!</p>
  <p>oh god thats a lot of smoke</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Thanks James</p>
