<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From October 11th, 2021</i></span></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Due to complications finding another lecturer I will act as the lecturer for the Planar Research Department.</p>
<p>This lecture will cover the basics of Plane Touch which is a condition that is one of the many risks of planar travel. Plane Touch has several ways of manifesting but there are a few patterns to Plane Touch that have been observed. It is my hope to properly caution you to this condition. I will start by saying that I am read on the topic but my level of expertise is not identical to some members of the Planar Research Department.</p>
<h3>Plane Touch</h3>
<p>Plane Touch is generally characterized as an alteration of your mental state that occurs after travel to another plane of existence and does not leave even after return to a native plane. Frequency of travel and the number of planes one has traveled directly influence the chances of plane touch occurring. The Plane Touch condition has various levels of intensity and several different ways it can manifest, the most minor of which might not be immediately apparent. It is known however that the condition becomes exponentially more dangerous to the individual and alters their perception in a greater way as more travel occurs once the condition has manifested. There is no way to determine what trip might cause the condition until after it has happened and some people are able to travel more often than others before the condition manifests. Generally the most mild of cases present as anxiety and slight paranoia. The most extreme cases lead to rationalizing the unthinkable, very aggressive activity, sensory shutdown, multi-sensory hallucinations, and eventually parts of your body failing or atrophying. Cross examining the research of your plane it is best described as a disconnect from the nervous system. This could mean one "forgets" how to breath or experiences paralysis. What is most troubling is the condition can occur with as little as a single movement from native plane to a foreign one.</p>
<p>Plane Touch has numerical classifications to determine intensity. Class 1 means the condition is present but not outwardly apparent even without alchemical treatment. This class is very difficult to determine its presence without intensive investigation and may even slip by without the afflicted knowing. Class 2 is outwardly apparent without alchemical treatment but allows the afflicted to function uninhibited. Class 3 requires the use of alchemical treatment to function as though not afflicted. Class 4 means dependency on others is required without alchemical treatment and their life is greatly affected even with treatment. Class 5 is potentially lethal without treatment and dependency is created even with treatment. It is not certain why but Class 4 will spontaneously worsen either suddenly or by slow degradation into Class 5. Due to the limitations of treatment Class 4 is regarded as terminal.</p>
<p>My apologies as I'm pacing myself. This is a sensitive subject for me. While I have never been determined to be Plane Touched I've seen a lot of my friends go through it. I am one of the lucky ones who has never been afflicted.</p>
<p>The condition of Plane Touch even in Class one is the beginning of a very fast downward slope should there be continued travel. While there are recorded instances where the individual who was Plane Touched did not experience their condition getting worse after travel it is very rare. Typically additional travel causes extreme changes to the condition. Some who are afflicted Class 1 may jump to Class 4 after a single jump to another plane. During field exercises off plane there is an expectation of loss so they are routinely over staffed. Those who typically take on these assignments are provided compensation for the hazards of Planar travel. With this noted it is also understood that once one has traveled the stress or whatever it might be that causes this condition will not occur again should an individual travel to the same plane. For this reason those who have traveled off plane will often be reassigned to duties on the same foreign plane as they may travel in a relatively safe way from then on.</p>
<p>Even with the safety from further deterioration however travel to other planes comes with additional risks. Sometimes ones own physiology takes additional stress from the travel as the Belthidian laws differ from one plane to another. It is important to recognize that all planar travel comes with risks and only those who are aware of and accept these risks should do field work off plane. While we do need researchers to conduct extra-planar work the Planar Research Department has plenty of on-plane work as well. Please make certain in the future that this work is something you wish to be part of when you ask for extra planar assignments in the future should you become part of our research team.</p>
<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chuck</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have any ways to treat plane touch?</p>
  <p>Blaise</p>
  <p>There are some sedative alchemical compounds that have had some effectiveness on more mild cases.</p>
  <p>There is a lot of superstition around Plane Touch however which has led to several "treatments" without much success.</p>
  <p><strong>Chuck</strong></p>
  <p>Like miracle cures? Could we get some examples?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are some people who embrace the idea of therapy though intense stimulation. This usually is done through fear treatment or long term sensory deprivation followed by intense sound, pain, heat/cold, and light. These are not accepted treatments but unfortunately still occur.</p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Brandon/Saber725</strong></p>
  <p>It doesn't sound like there's any of sort of cure. Is there a way for those traveling between planes to reduce the risk or prepare for it?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are again superstitions and there is in fact a temple who has their own ideas about the travel but no real way to properly prepare oneself to minimize risk as far as we have discovered. One might say "pray to your chosen god" but ultimately there is no verifiable proof you have control. Some believe it is dependent on a mental hardiness or an ability for your mind to accept the seemingly impossible. Some think its extreme mental stress that is not immediately consciously present that causes drastic alterations to how your mind and body interact. There is much we still don't know but the subject has been heavily studied.</p>
  <p>We have discovered much about the body's connection to the mind for this reason.</p>
  <p>Questions before I continue?</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>what are the common symptoms for each class level?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>General anxiety or mild paranoia are common in Class 1. In Class 2 mild visual impairment, sudden changes in temperament, decreased motor skills, and muscular weakness are all common. Class 3 and on are so varied I wouldn't call any common but anything you could imagine. I've known people who could not feel pain but were certain they could experience it. Others who certain components of their body atrophied rapidly, they lost their teeth in their first week and gums became necrotic.</p>
  <p>Anything else?</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Are there ways of testing plane-traveling people as they return to determine if they have becoming inflicted?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are a series of tests our physicians conduct to assess if a person might be afflicted but it is not always caught</p>
  <p>Exiting questions and recommendations for future Planar lectures or the upcoming Engineering lecture?</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>If someone successfully travels to a plane with no infliction of plane-touched, is said person "immune" to becoming plane-touched as they travel to/from that plane? Or is it more of a "literally every single jump is a risk" kind of scenario?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>They would be safe to travel that plane, yes</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Additionally, for future Planar lecture, I'd love to hear about the actual process of jumping planes</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Without proper background that lecture might be much too short</p>
  <p><strong>Brandon/Saber725</strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps an introduction to Planar Travel lecture?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Let me see if there is a way that I can expound on it enough to encompass a full lecture otherwise I'll need to get another lecturer from Planar.</p>

<h4><strong>Blaise </strong>**Notes on future lectures**</h4>
<p>Researcher Soot was assigned to provide a topic but we have yet to hear from him. Should he be unable to make it I will again conduct the lecture. Researcher Soot has a very irregular schedule. Those who are assigned extra planar field work are provided one of two types of training. Either KPET or UT. Known Planar Environment Training and Unknown Training. I had KPET for your plane. It was only a few intervals. UT however is typically 90 intervals. UT is for unvisited coordinates. This almost always means planes. We have noticed in distance planes, those multiple rings away, there are higher chances in developing the condition. But yes, there is a correlation. None, we are on the same ring. This is how I'm able to communicate effectively with you.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>About Rings</h4>
<p>You might want to look into the document created by the applicants or the "Ask Elham" section for more on this but we use rings to denote the location in space relative to our own plane. Ring 1 being where we are and Ring 8 being the center of all things. There is also something we call the other side which is everything beyond Ring 8. Through tests we verify such space exists and time would flow identically to us here as it would in Ring 15.</p>
