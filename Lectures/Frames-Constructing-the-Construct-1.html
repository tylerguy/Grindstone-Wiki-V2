<h6>Introductory Statements</h6>
<p>I hope that each and every persons enjoys this one. I'm certain many of you, especially those in necromancy, have been curious about the basics of creating constructs. Note that what I am about to teach you is a very high level understanding and does not incorporate the specifics of the casting to begin creating constructs. We will start on the large end while examining constructs and break it down slowly over lectures while Aetherial Studies provides the theory and vocabulary to understand the little pieces when we get to it. Unlike previous lectures I will actually start this topic with questions which I encourage you to ask. Also I highly recommend looking at Pauchik's lecture and the previous lecture on frames to better understand this material.</p>
<h6>Material Body</h6>
<p>As you know the material body can be crafted out of most things and its motion is determined by a series of thermokinetic spells that are part of the programming. Crystalline structures and lead are hardly ever used in the creation of full frames of even utilized in additions to undead. Crystalline structures more readily disperse the aether that frames are made of and specialized casting is necessary to make it easier to create these constructs. Specialized casting is however much easier to deal with than the effects of lead which soak up aether like a sponge and violently rip apart the frames as they are made. For this reason you don't see a lead full frame walking about. With virtually unlimited options to creating full frames and with so few experts capable of creating full frames due to time, resources, and the level of training necessary these constructs are built not only as capable creations to do tasks but also pieces of art that are often given a way to distinguish them from other creators. Sometimes this means an aetherial mark for early creations but typically exotic or precious materials, artistic stamps, and several other options exist to make certain others know the creation to be your work.</p>
<p>Full frames are works of art and while they may be able to do more and act more efficiently they should be treated with respect as the pieces of art they are. A Belthian Security Full Frame is distinguishable with a collar, there are those who make their constructs to look like dolls, Others try for the most realistic face possible, still others are very selective of their materials and dyes. If however any material does leave the area which the spells for motility intend to act on then they simply lay inanimate.</p>
<p>The body itself is a work of art but really all the hard work goes into the skeleton of these constructs. What really makes the construct and what takes so long to learn how to create, the frames.</p>
<p>We will briefly break before continuing about frames.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>So just a reminder for myself, basically you can use any material to create a construct on the contingency it doesn’t latch onto Aether and not let it go and such?</p>
  <p>(Like lead)</p>
  <p>And I think I read it somewhere that things with crystalline structures didn’t work as well for aetherial casting stuffs</p>
  <p>:thinking:</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>How important is it in building constructs that each part/module of the building material is made to accommodate the frame lining, or will the aetherial frame match itself to the construct's model during casting?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>When we use the word material we refer to the matter, be it wood, iron, whatever that the aetherial frame is (hopefully) built inside. What moves the material which is the body you can interact with is thermokinetics spells.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (And I think I read it somewhere that things with crystalline structures didn’t work as well for aetherial casting stuffs)</p>
  <p>Crystalline structures (depending) can be more conductive of it but also let it go easier while led has a hard time of letting go.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @DovaDonut</strong> (How important is it in building constructs that each part/module of the building material is made to accommodate the frame lining…)</p>
  <p>The frame can be created in free space. Why the frame is built into the material body is because you want to limit exposure.</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Oh, that makes a good deal of sense. I should touch up my memory on the anatomy of frames, too</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Might learn some extra anatomy tonight!</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>Perfect</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Any other questions before we start large and break down constructs slowly?</p>
  <p>I'll give it to 20 after</p>
  <p>Alright, on to the lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Questions?</p>
  <p>I will give this until 33 after</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>these are some questions about older topics that i had after rereading today</p>
  <p>what is immaterial?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Ask away! We will only continue to explore and delve deeper.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>and can you elaborate on the command pulse</p>
  <p>summation was said to require concentrated beams of almost no radius to stop and combine, are these beams created by the caster or naturally forming?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Hmm... I cannot discuss the immaterial in this section unfortunately.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>;-;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald</strong> (summation was said to require concentrated beams of almost no radius to stop and combine, are these beams created by the caster…)</p>
  <p>By the caster.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok thanks</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>When we say lead absorbs aether like a sponge, that's only for any aether lines that have a direct volume overlap with it, yeah? Could it be possible to coat material parts of the frame with lead to avoid possible wave interferences from other points of aeonization? Sorta like a shield, I guess.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>alright let me read through the lecture and i will probably have more questions</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Like how some wires use rubber to insulate themselves, I suppose.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The command pulse helps determine the sequence of interactions of segments. There must be a way to halt or continue the operation of a segment for multiple reasons.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are these any insulators of aether? that dont absorb at all?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name</strong> (When we say lead absorbs aether like a sponge, that's only for any aether lines that have a direct volume overlap with it, yeah? …)</p>
  <p>If the lead is far enough away from the frame yes.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh right, absorption. I suppose a Faraday cage would've been a more proper analogy.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though I can think of a few complications depending on how it is done such has making it more difficult to access the frame for maintenance.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(are these any insulators of aether? that dont absorb at all?)</p>
  <p>The aether cannot occupy the same space technically as other aether. I don't want to steer you wrong so that's a question for Aetherial Studies or Planar. There are those materials, which are very common, that it is negligible.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Tip, keep asking questions and I'll just have to keep coming back.</p>
  <p>Not tomorrow though, game night.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>How would diamonds interact with a frame? I know they're used in four points with diamond dust ink.</p>
  <p>It seemed like they had some specific interactions with aether?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is the skeleton the aetherial part</p>
  <p><strong>Name @Name</strong> (How would diamonds interact with a frame? I know they're used in four points with diamond dust ink.)</p>
  <p>Oh wait. Diamonds are crystalline.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>If it isn't being used for components I would say it would act well as a crystalline material.</p>
  <p>Are we assuming it passes directly through the frame?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Sure, I was imagining just in close proximity though, but it’d be good to know if that happens.</p>
  <p>Ah that’s already in the lecture, ain’t it? Disperses the aether.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what do you mean by if the material leaves the area mobility stops working?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>So, imagine you cast a thermokinetics spell first.</p>
  <p>Lets say that spell is to move an an object. You don't necessarily target an object as much as you target a space where the object is.</p>
  <p>A construct is essentially several, several spells.</p>
  <p>A spell tells a structure created from perpetual spell casting to cast a spell that leads to action, rinse and repeat just very complicated.</p>
  <p>The frame casts the thermo spell which moves the target area.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what is casting the perpetual spells</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that the construct can use that is similar to contingency casting without the aetheral frame intersecting with it? (if the construct programmed with that in mind at least)</p>
  <p>and sorry for interrupting</p>
  <p><strong>Name @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that the construct…)</p>
  <p>You thinking of giant robots duking it out with diamond or even lead hammers?</p>
  <p><strong>Vel Blackwood</strong></p>
  <p>Hm</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>perhaps diamond swords, and the robots could be made of iron</p>
  <p>wait a second</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter @ThisIsAName0 </strong>(You thinking of giant robots duking it out with diamond or even lead hammers?)</p>
  <p>I suppose xD I guess I was thinking as using a crystalline material would be used like a spell scope</p>
  <p>like a focus or something xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(what is casting the perpetual spells)</p>
  <p>Perhaps when we break down frames much, much more it'll make more sense. More microscopic than macroscopic where we are now.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that…)</p>
  <p>Clever thought and I'll actually get into how lead and crystalline structures are useful in future lectures on aetherial mechanisms (my specialty)</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>ooooh good to know!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Diamond might be a bit....impractical.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>has there ever been sabotage of constructs using lead during wars or something</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(has there ever been sabotage of constructs using lead during wars or something)</p>
  <p>Absolutely, I did it many times.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>very cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>I also reprogrammed constructs.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>That sounds harder than just making a construct xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>that sounds very dangerous in a war setting</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Afterall, the revolutionaries didn't exactly have full frames lying around.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>fair enough</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter </strong>(That sounds harder than just making a construct xD)</p>
  <p>It can be, I'll teach you security techniques and personal shortcuts eventually.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>I love that</p>
  <p>xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>There are ways utilizing redundancy and other less obvious spells to sabotage or create a more secure full frame.</p>
  <p>Imagine cutting the wrong part of a program and then suddenly it forces aetherial exhaust through incomplete spells.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh no</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You are not only one construct down you are one programmer down.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah that sounds... deadly</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Undead are more practical in war time. &nbsp;Full Frames while they would be ideal are still very expensive and time consuming. &nbsp;Not to mention the idea of a combat capable full frame is rather intimidating. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>gahhh wording questions is hard</p>
  <p>Are there constructs that move other disconnected objects like that the were connected? Like a handle and a tool head that aren't physically connected but still move together like they were?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>not sure if we've gone over this before but are there constructs that could program other constructs</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely. &nbsp;Constructs continue to become more and more articulate and detailed all the time. &nbsp;Belthian Security Full Frames can hold several objects and answer to hundreds of commands.</p>
  <p>Well... &nbsp;Technically only about a dozen with slight alterations.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>clarification are the skeletons aetherial only</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I consider a dozen several xD</p>
  <p>even if they are only slightly different</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Simple then absolutely, complicated then in theory.</p>
  <p>I don't think a full frame will be ready to put another full frame together for a century or so really.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p>emerald &nbsp;</p>
  <p>so could single contingent caster production be automated for example</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Contingent Single Caster or Contingent Casting?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>the scrolls</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>CSCs then.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i am reminded of glider makers in conway's game of life kinda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyrtJn5eK5U</p>
  <p>yes</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>so to build off of this, if this is true, then is it possible to have like remotely controlled construct battle/dangerous work automatons that like mimic a person's movements so a person could potentially do work or stuff without actually physically being there?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>magic drones</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>CSCs could but eventually the constructs would need maintenance or begin creating exhaust each time they attempt the CSC construction. &nbsp;More advanced CSCs should probably still be made by experts unless the construct was one hell of a intricate aetherial mechanism.</p>
  <p>Also real quick, 3 DPC to Emerald, Autumn, and Name @Infernal Affairs</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Honestly asking questions is a two in one deal I get knowledge and dpc</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>pfft xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Certainly but the cruel reality is people are cheaper.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oof</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah I figured, I would've just thought that eventually it would be nice to have that kind of work be able to be done that way, because it would be safer for people ;-;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That's why the people of my department try to find more efficient ways and shortcuts. &nbsp;Maybe one day we can make constructs cost effective to remove hazardous work and improve the lives of others.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I think that with the establishment of umad this future would be faster realized</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>One of the many ways the Necromancy Department makes life better.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I'd hope so!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean look at how much our world ha improved in terms of tech</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Careful now, IA might think you a suck up and recommend you for promotion.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oof</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Lamont</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>are there any un-NTK projects you're working on? besides i thiiink like, communication things were mentioned</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Working on or have worked on?</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Either, i suppose. Successes or failures.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Currently, none I can speak of in this channel. &nbsp;As for in the past, I have a few.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I also don't mean to interrupt, just getting it out while i was thinking of it lol.</p>
  <p>That's faaair</p>
  <p>though i'd try anyway lol</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>No problem at all.</p>
  <p>I did create a line that can be added to programmers dolls to provide messages upon recognizing a target person assuming they do so before loss of animation and immolation.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a roof for how many contingency spells (like the CSCs I think I mean) that can be placed on a single object? If there is a limit is it imposed by Aether not being able to overlap itself and thus more limited by area than other factors?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0 &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh wait, so touching upon an earlier question I had, so crystalline structures disperse, and lead absorbs, is it possible to have lead with one side coated in crystalline dust, so that it absorbs aether from one side but has its absorption negated by the dispersion due to crystalline on the other side, providing like, a one-way sponge while not interfering with aether on the crystalline side?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>So I suppose I'm a spellcrafter too.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>In the case of two physically separate objects in the same construct, does the frame have to be connected?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>In the case of two physically separate objects in the same construct, does the frame have to be connected?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>This is a very complicated question. &nbsp;I think we should fine tune it a bit and I think future lectures will help with that.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That sounds super cool, but wouldn’t an issue with that is that the lead would ruin the programming and basically make a Aether exhaust canon?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>If the aether was present in the crystalline structure it would readily move to the lead upon contact.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>I was thinking we can moderate the diamond so that it's enough to prevent aether moving into lead, but also not making an exhaust cannon.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Ahh so the opposite problem than what I thought xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Frames and material bodies don't need to be connected though we would classify multiple frames as multiple constructs and this is typical for very large constructs for redundancy. &nbsp;The term is Complex Construct.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>I’m just over here trying to fine tune my question xD</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So the aether is only dispersed by crystalline structures if it overlaps with it?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Kind of on the same line, you mentioned erasing programming lines in undead using lead , can you control or predict how lead would affect programming?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oooh like an aetherial scalpel?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Good comparison</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I think an analogy utilizing conductors and superconductors for electricity would be helpful though I want to make certain my terminology is adequate. &nbsp;If the crystalline structure comes in contact with a frame or a frame is made inside one it would readily spread out the aether evenly in the structure though you can make tight fitting frames that are pulled on but don't actually break down and disperse. &nbsp;That's why you would need a specialist. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>A good programmer reading the programming can.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Very cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>It's called a PAAD.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’m not understanding your grammar when you say a frame of a frame</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Sounds fun xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p>I'll correct it</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh that makes sense</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>not of</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What does PAAD stand for?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>^</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Precision Aetherial Augmentation Device</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’m guessing one A stands for Aether/aetherial</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Basically a little lead stick</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p>Don’t chew on the lead stick</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I've got two on me.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Is lead toxic to you</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Don't need them here but it can be kinda comforting.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Because we usually wouldn’t keep lead on our person</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>It is to human biology at least xD</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Makes sense!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Probably? &nbsp;From what we are learning on EXT-918 we are probably poisoning ourselves on PM-1 often.</p>
