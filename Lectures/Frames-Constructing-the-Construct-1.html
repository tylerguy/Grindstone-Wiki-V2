<h6>Introductory Statements</h6>
<p>I hope that each and every persons enjoys this one. I'm certain many of you, especially those in necromancy, have been curious about the basics of creating constructs. Note that what I am about to teach you is a very high level understanding and does not incorporate the specifics of the casting to begin creating constructs. We will start on the large end while examining constructs and break it down slowly over lectures while Aetherial Studies provides the theory and vocabulary to understand the little pieces when we get to it. Unlike previous lectures I will actually start this topic with questions which I encourage you to ask. Also I highly recommend looking at Pauchik's lecture and the previous lecture on frames to better understand this material.</p>
<h6>Material Body</h6>
<p>As you know the material body can be crafted out of most things and its motion is determined by a series of thermokinetic spells that are part of the programming. Crystalline structures and lead are hardly ever used in the creation of full frames of even utilized in additions to undead. Crystalline structures more readily disperse the aether that frames are made of and specialized casting is necessary to make it easier to create these constructs. Specialized casting is however much easier to deal with than the effects of lead which soak up aether like a sponge and violently rip apart the frames as they are made. For this reason you don't see a lead full frame walking about. With virtually unlimited options to creating full frames and with so few experts capable of creating full frames due to time, resources, and the level of training necessary these constructs are built not only as capable creations to do tasks but also pieces of art that are often given a way to distinguish them from other creators. Sometimes this means an aetherial mark for early creations but typically exotic or precious materials, artistic stamps, and several other options exist to make certain others know the creation to be your work.</p>
<p>Full frames are works of art and while they may be able to do more and act more efficiently they should be treated with respect as the pieces of art they are. A Belthian Security Full Frame is distinguishable with a collar, there are those who make their constructs to look like dolls, Others try for the most realistic face possible, still others are very selective of their materials and dyes. If however any material does leave the area which the spells for motility intend to act on then they simply lay inanimate.</p>
<p>The body itself is a work of art but really all the hard work goes into the skeleton of these constructs. What really makes the construct and what takes so long to learn how to create, the frames.</p>
<p>We will briefly break before continuing about frames.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>So just a reminder for myself, basically you can use any material to create a construct on the contingency it doesn’t latch onto Aether and not let it go and such?</p>
  <p>(Like lead)</p>
  <p>And I think I read it somewhere that things with crystalline structures didn’t work as well for aetherial casting stuffs</p>
  <p>:thinking:</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>How important is it in building constructs that each part/module of the building material is made to accommodate the frame lining, or will the aetherial frame match itself to the construct's model during casting?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>When we use the word material we refer to the matter, be it wood, iron, whatever that the aetherial frame is (hopefully) built inside. What moves the material which is the body you can interact with is thermokinetics spells.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (And I think I read it somewhere that things with crystalline structures didn’t work as well for aetherial casting stuffs)</p>
  <p>Crystalline structures (depending) can be more conductive of it but also let it go easier while led has a hard time of letting go.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @DovaDonut</strong> (How important is it in building constructs that each part/module of the building material is made to accommodate the frame lining…)</p>
  <p>The frame can be created in free space. Why the frame is built into the material body is because you want to limit exposure.</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Oh, that makes a good deal of sense. I should touch up my memory on the anatomy of frames, too</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Might learn some extra anatomy tonight!</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>Perfect</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Any other questions before we start large and break down constructs slowly?</p>
  <p>I'll give it to 20 after</p>
  <p>Alright, on to the lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Questions?</p>
  <p>I will give this until 33 after</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>these are some questions about older topics that i had after rereading today</p>
  <p>what is immaterial?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Ask away! We will only continue to explore and delve deeper.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>and can you elaborate on the command pulse</p>
  <p>summation was said to require concentrated beams of almost no radius to stop and combine, are these beams created by the caster or naturally forming?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Hmm... I cannot discuss the immaterial in this section unfortunately.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>;-;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald</strong> (summation was said to require concentrated beams of almost no radius to stop and combine, are these beams created by the caster…)</p>
  <p>By the caster.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok thanks</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>When we say lead absorbs aether like a sponge, that's only for any aether lines that have a direct volume overlap with it, yeah? Could it be possible to coat material parts of the frame with lead to avoid possible wave interferences from other points of aeonization? Sorta like a shield, I guess.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>alright let me read through the lecture and i will probably have more questions</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Like how some wires use rubber to insulate themselves, I suppose.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The command pulse helps determine the sequence of interactions of segments. There must be a way to halt or continue the operation of a segment for multiple reasons.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are these any insulators of aether? that dont absorb at all?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Name</strong> (When we say lead absorbs aether like a sponge, that's only for any aether lines that have a direct volume overlap with it, yeah? …)</p>
  <p>If the lead is far enough away from the frame yes.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh right, absorption. I suppose a Faraday cage would've been a more proper analogy.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though I can think of a few complications depending on how it is done such has making it more difficult to access the frame for maintenance.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(are these any insulators of aether? that dont absorb at all?)</p>
  <p>The aether cannot occupy the same space technically as other aether. I don't want to steer you wrong so that's a question for Aetherial Studies or Planar. There are those materials, which are very common, that it is negligible.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Tip, keep asking questions and I'll just have to keep coming back.</p>
  <p>Not tomorrow though, game night.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>How would diamonds interact with a frame? I know they're used in four points with diamond dust ink.</p>
  <p>It seemed like they had some specific interactions with aether?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is the skeleton the aetherial part</p>
  <p><strong>Name @Name</strong> (How would diamonds interact with a frame? I know they're used in four points with diamond dust ink.)</p>
  <p>Oh wait. Diamonds are crystalline.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>If it isn't being used for components I would say it would act well as a crystalline material.</p>
  <p>Are we assuming it passes directly through the frame?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Sure, I was imagining just in close proximity though, but it’d be good to know if that happens.</p>
  <p>Ah that’s already in the lecture, ain’t it? Disperses the aether.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what do you mean by if the material leaves the area mobility stops working?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>So, imagine you cast a thermokinetics spell first.</p>
  <p>Lets say that spell is to move an an object. You don't necessarily target an object as much as you target a space where the object is.</p>
  <p>A construct is essentially several, several spells.</p>
  <p>A spell tells a structure created from perpetual spell casting to cast a spell that leads to action, rinse and repeat just very complicated.</p>
  <p>The frame casts the thermo spell which moves the target area.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what is casting the perpetual spells</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that the construct can use that is similar to contingency casting without the aetheral frame intersecting with it? (if the construct programmed with that in mind at least)</p>
  <p>and sorry for interrupting</p>
  <p><strong>Name @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that the construct…)</p>
  <p>You thinking of giant robots duking it out with diamond or even lead hammers?</p>
  <p><strong>Vel Blackwood</strong></p>
  <p>Hm</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>perhaps diamond swords, and the robots could be made of iron</p>
  <p>wait a second</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter @Name </strong>(You thinking of giant robots duking it out with diamond or even lead hammers?)</p>
  <p>I suppose xD I guess I was thinking as using a crystalline material would be used like a spell scope</p>
  <p>like a focus or something xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(what is casting the perpetual spells)</p>
  <p>Perhaps when we break down frames much, much more it'll make more sense. More microscopic than macroscopic where we are now.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter</strong> (Since crystalline structures more readily disperses aether, are they often used for construct weaponry? As like a tool that…)</p>
  <p>Clever thought and I'll actually get into how lead and crystalline structures are useful in future lectures on aetherial mechanisms (my specialty)</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>ooooh good to know!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Diamond might be a bit....impractical.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>has there ever been sabotage of constructs using lead during wars or something</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(has there ever been sabotage of constructs using lead during wars or something)</p>
  <p>Absolutely, I did it many times.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>very cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>I also reprogrammed constructs.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>That sounds harder than just making a construct xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>that sounds very dangerous in a war setting</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Afterall, the revolutionaries didn't exactly have full frames lying around.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>fair enough</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @TheAutumnWriter </strong>(That sounds harder than just making a construct xD)</p>
  <p>It can be, I'll teach you security techniques and personal shortcuts eventually.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>I love that</p>
  <p>xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>There are ways utilizing redundancy and other less obvious spells to sabotage or create a more secure full frame.</p>
  <p>Imagine cutting the wrong part of a program and then suddenly it forces aetherial exhaust through incomplete spells.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh no</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You are not only one construct down you are one programmer down.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah that sounds... deadly</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Undead are more practical in war time. &nbsp;Full Frames while they would be ideal are still very expensive and time consuming. &nbsp;Not to mention the idea of a combat capable full frame is rather intimidating. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>gahhh wording questions is hard</p>
  <p>Are there constructs that move other disconnected objects like that the were connected? Like a handle and a tool head that aren't physically connected but still move together like they were?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>not sure if we've gone over this before but are there constructs that could program other constructs</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely. &nbsp;Constructs continue to become more and more articulate and detailed all the time. &nbsp;Belthian Security Full Frames can hold several objects and answer to hundreds of commands.</p>
  <p>Well... &nbsp;Technically only about a dozen with slight alterations.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>clarification are the skeletons aetherial only</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I consider a dozen several xD</p>
  <p>even if they are only slightly different</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Simple then absolutely, complicated then in theory.</p>
  <p>I don't think a full frame will be ready to put another full frame together for a century or so really.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p>emerald &nbsp;</p>
  <p>so could single contingent caster production be automated for example</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Contingent Single Caster or Contingent Casting?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>the scrolls</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>CSCs then.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i am reminded of glider makers in conway's game of life kinda https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyrtJn5eK5U</p>
  <p>yes</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>so to build off of this, if this is true, then is it possible to have like remotely controlled construct battle/dangerous work automatons that like mimic a person's movements so a person could potentially do work or stuff without actually physically being there?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>magic drones</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>CSCs could but eventually the constructs would need maintenance or begin creating exhaust each time they attempt the CSC construction. &nbsp;More advanced CSCs should probably still be made by experts unless the construct was one hell of a intricate aetherial mechanism.</p>
  <p>Also real quick, 3 DPC to Emerald, Autumn, and Name @Infernal Affairs</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Honestly asking questions is a two in one deal I get knowledge and dpc</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>pfft xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Certainly but the cruel reality is people are cheaper.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oof</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yeah I figured, I would've just thought that eventually it would be nice to have that kind of work be able to be done that way, because it would be safer for people ;-;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That's why the people of my department try to find more efficient ways and shortcuts. &nbsp;Maybe one day we can make constructs cost effective to remove hazardous work and improve the lives of others.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I think that with the establishment of umad this future would be faster realized</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>One of the many ways the Necromancy Department makes life better.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I'd hope so!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean look at how much our world ha improved in terms of tech</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Careful now, IA might think you a suck up and recommend you for promotion.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oof</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Lamont</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>are there any un-NTK projects you're working on? besides i thiiink like, communication things were mentioned</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Working on or have worked on?</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Either, i suppose. Successes or failures.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Currently, none I can speak of in this channel. &nbsp;As for in the past, I have a few.</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I also don't mean to interrupt, just getting it out while i was thinking of it lol.</p>
  <p>That's faaair</p>
  <p>though i'd try anyway lol</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>No problem at all.</p>
  <p>I did create a line that can be added to programmers dolls to provide messages upon recognizing a target person assuming they do so before loss of animation and immolation.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a roof for how many contingency spells (like the CSCs I think I mean) that can be placed on a single object? If there is a limit is it imposed by Aether not being able to overlap itself and thus more limited by area than other factors?</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh wait, so touching upon an earlier question I had, so crystalline structures disperse, and lead absorbs, is it possible to have lead with one side coated in crystalline dust, so that it absorbs aether from one side but has its absorption negated by the dispersion due to crystalline on the other side, providing like, a one-way sponge while not interfering with aether on the crystalline side?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>So I suppose I'm a spellcrafter too.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>In the case of two physically separate objects in the same construct, does the frame have to be connected?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>In the case of two physically separate objects in the same construct, does the frame have to be connected?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>This is a very complicated question. &nbsp;I think we should fine tune it a bit and I think future lectures will help with that.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That sounds super cool, but wouldn’t an issue with that is that the lead would ruin the programming and basically make a Aether exhaust canon?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>If the aether was present in the crystalline structure it would readily move to the lead upon contact.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>I was thinking we can moderate the diamond so that it's enough to prevent aether moving into lead, but also not making an exhaust cannon.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Ahh so the opposite problem than what I thought xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Frames and material bodies don't need to be connected though we would classify multiple frames as multiple constructs and this is typical for very large constructs for redundancy. &nbsp;The term is Complex Construct.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>I’m just over here trying to fine tune my question xD</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>So the aether is only dispersed by crystalline structures if it overlaps with it?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Kind of on the same line, you mentioned erasing programming lines in undead using lead , can you control or predict how lead would affect programming?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oooh like an aetherial scalpel?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Good comparison</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I think an analogy utilizing conductors and superconductors for electricity would be helpful though I want to make certain my terminology is adequate. &nbsp;If the crystalline structure comes in contact with a frame or a frame is made inside one it would readily spread out the aether evenly in the structure though you can make tight fitting frames that are pulled on but don't actually break down and disperse. &nbsp;That's why you would need a specialist. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>A good programmer reading the programming can.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Very cool</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>It's called a PAAD.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’m not understanding your grammar when you say a frame of a frame</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Sounds fun xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p>I'll correct it</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh that makes sense</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>not of</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>What does PAAD stand for?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>^</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Precision Aetherial Augmentation Device</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’m guessing one A stands for Aether/aetherial</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Basically a little lead stick</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p>Don’t chew on the lead stick</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I've got two on me.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Is lead toxic to you</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Don't need them here but it can be kinda comforting.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Because we usually wouldn’t keep lead on our person</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>It is to human biology at least xD</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Makes sense!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Probably? &nbsp;From what we are learning on EXT-918 we are probably poisoning ourselves on PM-1 often.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Mmmm</p>
  <p>I’d stay away from asbestos and radium also</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Oh, is there something that would be akin to an Atherial soldering iron? For use in programming?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Some of us drink from lead cups even depending on where you are from.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh my</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh no</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That’s uh, no bueno</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>不好</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>dont do that</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Not really, connecting two points just takes developing the line.</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>especially not with any acidic drinks &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fair enough! I’m just trying to see how much of my electrical circuiting knowledge is applicable to some degree to this topic xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>You'd be surprised.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Probably!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do lead compounds act the same way</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>I guess it depends on how current your studies are. 😏</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>For example PbNO3 which is this really petty shimmering golden color and is also very toxic</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You mean like an alloy of lead?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Either I guess</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Nice</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Good pun</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I'd ask alchemy. &nbsp;I practice KISS.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Whic is?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Keep it simple stupid.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Ooof</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Good rule</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>That's directed at me.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I know xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>I think I'm bright but I'm no alchemist so eliminating uncertainty when taking data is important.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Very true</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’m assuming a pure iron bar and a steel bar would have sightly different interactions with Aether?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Understandable!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Slightly but that is an aetherial studies topic of research.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Fair enough</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>so a slighty off topic question but can you do/how do and/or/logic gates with the lines work &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>How far away / how quiet could a construct detect a spoken word command</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Ooh yes</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>@Infernal Affairs 3 DPC to Thyme</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I was going to ask about looping and recursion on full frames also</p>
  <p>Good job thyme!</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Gj!!!</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>wait we can get dpc for asking quesitons</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Yes</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>I did not know that was a thing</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Certain ones I think.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Depends on the questions</p>
  <p>I think</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I got 10 for asking about the appearance of frames and aetherial marks yesterday</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>What you are asking about will be explained when we get into the nitty gritty of creating a program but yes you can.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Today autumn name and I got 3 just for asking lots of questions I guess</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You don’t learn as much from ‘What is’ questions rather than ‘how/why’ is I’d think</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>fun</p>
  <p>cant wait for that then</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I’ll just be forever sad that there is knowledge harder for me to get because it’s more related to necromancy/any other department;-;</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>that is sad</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I want to know everything ;-;</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Me wondering how I could've used sicc maffs in the Necromancy department.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You can use sicc maffs in planar too</p>
  <p>But yeah necro is pretty cool</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>ngl no actual math has happend yet in necro &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Oh I already use sicc maffs in Planar, but it's a different type of math I was thinking of when I'd think of math to use in necro. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>its all just stuff that will eventaully happen</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Lots of comms stuff right now</p>
  <p>Next necromancy department: solve anime problems and stop procrastinating on them, emerald</p>
  <p>Seriously though I hope we get coding challenges lol</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh, so I know that aether has like three charges, how that affect programming and the math from how we might have an understanding for here on EXT-918?</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>anime problems</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>YES</p>
  <p>PLEASE</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Calculating anime physics like</p>
  <p><strong>Tyler</strong></p>
  <p>^</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>thatd be fun</p>
  <p>but yah we need coding problems so badly</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Pls</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>the current work is all just copying wikipedias</p>
  <p><strong>mediocre</strong></p>
  <p>copying? or educating umad 😏</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Everything can be broken down to algebra but trig is handy.</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>you guys can read wikipedias just as well as we can</p>
  <p>you dont need us to copy and paste for you &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Also, while I know this is prolly more an aetheral studies question, do those charges act like the charges we have have for electricity? as in they are all attracted to each other and repelled by itself? or is it different? If it is different how is it different? &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>We’re the interns</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>good thing those are the maths i'm better at then xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Ooh maths do continue</p>
  <p>Can you refresh me on the charges</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>idk what their names are, we've just been calling them charges, A, B, and C</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>More an aetherial studies question but it is very survey.</p>
  <p>I know that they are going over this in the next aetherial studies lecture actually.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oooooooo exciting!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Basically the charged packets act either attracted to, repelled by, or indifferent depending on the charge interactions.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>that's fair 🤔</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The charges have multiple names but typically they are referred to within UMAD as Tor, Mot, and Up.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>That Up related to Up Theory?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though you could just say A, B, and C for simplicity.</p>
  <p>Related to but only by historical context.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Ah.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>mot as in motian? &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>It has an older name though that was retired, Acer.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oh that's good to know! i like putting names to things xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>It was a very...political decision between academics.</p>
  <p>Though I won't harp on you for calling in Tor, Mot, and Acer charges.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Understood</p>
  <p>I prefer Up anyway xD &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>whats the story there</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p>easier to type</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>^^</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>although i would prefer if it was three characters to match the rest</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Upp</p>
  <p>xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Uup lol</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Upu.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The Acer charge was named after a programmer but they don't really have a good reputation.</p>
  <p>T, M, U</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>why dont they have a good rep</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>oooh even better</p>
  <p><strong>Name&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Too Much Up.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>XD &nbsp;</p>
  <p>part of me now feels we've strayed a bit from the lecture &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>they should all rhyme</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Now is probably not a good time but Blaise or someone in culture MIGHT talk about it with you</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>tuppity muppity uppity</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>aww</p>
  <p>ill have to bug blaise then</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>well we are straying</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>We only have a few minutes left anyways. &nbsp;I'll be back again!</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>awww fair enough!</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>aww thats sad</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>i feel like i had an idea but can't think of it but ill write it down if it pops up</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I very much like these lectures but this must be the longest lasting one I've seen so far hahaha</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You guys seem to like programming.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>wait can you give a simple definition of programming for my notes</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>(as in like related topics)</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Aetherial will definitely give context.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>love programming and yet its the shortest section in my notes</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I mean programming is the 'casting' part of aetherial casting so I'd assume that lots of people would be interested xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I hope this has been educational for you all and you are starting to connect the dots a bit.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yes I would love context xD</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>def are</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>yep</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>this does help a bit! it's reinforces ideas i've already had and corrects other ones xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>its becoming more than a bunch of long words lol</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>though now i really want to know the technical implementation stuff of how youd actually do stuff</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>and reviewing lectures and stuff helped</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>its all so theoretical</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>that might take a while</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>We'll get there eventually Thyme</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You'll be animating the dead in no time.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>theory always comes before application xD</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>no</p>
  <p>no it doesnt</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>you can't apply stuff if you don't know anything about it</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>but like in our world for our version of programming you learn the two at once</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>We have to start with the high level and then get technical as this is a very cross disciplinary education.</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>often even learning the implementation then the thoery</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>...where would we get the dead</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>the morgue &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>dont ask</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>That's a you problem.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>the local graveyard?</p>
  <p>xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Or... just an animal</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>well excuse me, not all of us have the resources to just get dead people</p>
  <p><strong>Name &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Asking very nicely?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Oh that works too</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>maybe we start by animating dear rats from amazon</p>
  <p>i could get my cats to find some</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>why not just animate plushies</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Full frames are ambitious.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>that would be either cute or horrifying</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>probably start with animating dead bugs</p>
  <p>easiest corpses to find</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>easiest corpses to make</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Bugs might be a bit small.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>what are you planing emerald &gt;.&gt;</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>nothing</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>sus</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>shush</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>no</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Typically you start with you first contingent casting and build up to necromancy before you try things like unique aetherial mechanisms or full frames.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>alright i need to go now</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>let me in on the plan ;-;</p>
  <p>aww okay!</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>haha byeee</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>understandable!</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>cya</p>
  <p><strong>emerald &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>and dont worry ive got no plan</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>This concludes things for now. &nbsp;There will be more.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>I look forward to it!</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Aye, sounds good.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>too bad there will be no lecture tomorrow :16hahasob:</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>any actual time esitamtes on when well make our first contingent caster</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Not a logistics guy, just a logic guy. &nbsp;It really depends on how soon you get through necro lectures and the other relevant lectures. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>but like order of mangitude, a month, a year, or even longer &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>only if there were audio lectures that I could binge in 2 times speed ;-;</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Well, I've got this and 4 more lectures just for necro surveys and then you need to learn more planar and aetherial for all of the survey lectures to really click. &nbsp;Once we move on from surveys we will be going over information that assumes you have covered surveys elsewhere which means the earliest casting and contingent casting principals. &nbsp;After contingent casting principals and general rules you need practice.</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>that seems like a while</p>
  <p>so sad</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Necromancy isn't learned in a day unfortunately.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>all good things come with time?</p>
  <p><strong>Thyme</strong></p>
  <p>so are we able to do casting stuff in our plane</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though once you get through some really meaty coursework we can start advanced lectures which I happen to be qualified to give on aetherial mechanisms.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Please see your internal chat about this.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Excuse me while I retire to the 8th ring for a bit to learn everything and come back to see that virtually no time has passed at all.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter &nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>;-;</p>
  <p>xD</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Say hi to Doublelock</p>
  <p>Gonna go now. &nbsp;Keep up the hard work! &nbsp;So much more to come!</p>
