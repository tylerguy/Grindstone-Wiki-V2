<h6>Introductory Statements</h6>
<p>I hope that each and every persons enjoys this one. I'm certain many of you, especially those in necromancy, have been curious about the basics of creating constructs. Note that what I am about to teach you is a very high level understanding and does not incorporate the specifics of the casting to begin creating constructs. We will start on the large end while examining constructs and break it down slowly over lectures while Aetherial Studies provides the theory and vocabulary to understand the little pieces when we get to it. Unlike previous lectures I will actually start this topic with questions which I encourage you to ask. Also I highly recommend looking at Pauchik's lecture and the previous lecture on frames to better understand this material.</p>
<h6>Material Body</h6>
<p>As you know the material body can be crafted out of most things and its motion is determined by a series of thermokinetic spells that are part of the programming. Crystalline structures and lead are hardly ever used in the creation of full frames of even utilized in additions to undead. Crystalline structures more readily disperse the aether that frames are made of and specialized casting is necessary to make it easier to create these constructs. Specialized casting is however much easier to deal with than the effects of lead which soak up aether like a sponge and violently rip apart the frames as they are made. For this reason you don't see a lead full frame walking about. With virtually unlimited options to creating full frames and with so few experts capable of creating full frames due to time, resources, and the level of training necessary these constructs are built not only as capable creations to do tasks but also pieces of art that are often given a way to distinguish them from other creators. Sometimes this means an aetherial mark for early creations but typically exotic or precious materials, artistic stamps, and several other options exist to make certain others know the creation to be your work.</p>
<p>Full frames are works of art and while they may be able to do more and act more efficiently they should be treated with respect as the pieces of art they are. A Belthian Security Full Frame is distinguishable with a collar, there are those who make their constructs to look like dolls, Others try for the most realistic face possible, still others are very selective of their materials and dyes. If however any material does leave the area which the spells for motility intend to act on then they simply lay inanimate.</p>
<p>The body itself is a work of art but really all the hard work goes into the skeleton of these constructs. What really makes the construct and what takes so long to learn how to create, the frames.</p>
<p>We will briefly break before continuing about frames.</p>
