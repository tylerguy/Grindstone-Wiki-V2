<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
<p>Programming is one of the schools of magic, not to be confused with the stage of casting programming. The Necromancy Department deals a lot with this school of magic but it should be understood that the animation of the dead is only one way to create a construct. Constructs are made by the interaction of aetherial frames with the material in plane. A simple way to classify constructs are large and small frame. Note that small frame does not mean simple, it just means it occupies smaller space and we generally use different rules when creating them out of simplicity. Programming is a very complicated school of magic but shortcuts can be made. Unlike your coding directionality, rate, and intensity are all important for the frames but this also makes programming virtually limitless in possibilities. For this lecture I'll be discussing Undead constructs, Full Frame constructs, Aetherial Mechanism, and a little about Contingent Single Casters also known as scrolls. I'll let you all direct the lecture a bit though and we can pick what to talk about first together!</p>
<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>There is my opening! &nbsp;Lets talk about it!</p>
  <p>Any questions? &nbsp;Want me to talk about anything particular first?</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is there supposed to be a comma between coding and directionality in this sentence Unlike your coding directionality, rate, and intensity are all important for the frames but this also makes programming virtually limitless in possibilities</p>
  <p>and by our coding, do you mean like computer coding?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>I mean like computer coding yes!</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Just for clarification, what is a frame?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>A system of lines created using the aether that might move in space. &nbsp;Think of it like a skeleton for the body of a construct but it also contains the information for specific commands.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Wooaahhh</p>
  <p>That’s really cool</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Depending on what others wish to learn about, can I ask for the Aetherial Mechanism part of the lecture?</p>
  <p><strong>Sleeping Tyger</strong></p>
  <p>In what ways do directionality, rate, and intensity affect the frame?</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok so directionality, rate, and intensity are properties of directing the aether?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Hmmmm.... &nbsp;Maybe I should talk about those three characteristics in the frame and then move to a specific type? &nbsp;How does that sound everyone?</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>sure</p>
  <p><strong>Sleeping Tyger</strong></p>
  <p>That sounds good.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Alright!</p>
  <p><strong>feral, scheming little shit</strong></p>
  <p>ye!!</p>
  <p><strong>tired, scheming little frog</strong></p>
  <p>sounds good</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Okay! &nbsp;Gonna write that up real fast.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Frames</h3>
<p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
<p>Directionality, Rate, and Intensity are the three characteristics of frames. Unlike a river, faucet, or any other analogy using water that might be used for the flow of the aether in the aetherial matrix there is a command pulse for the interaction of the segments of a frame. Segments are portions of a line that have a terminus, sometimes two, which the aetherial pulse travels through and obeys certain simple actions. Some lines within the frame could have dozens, hundreds, or in extreme cases thousands of segments to properly program. In the case of the large number of segments many of the segments might have several directions of facing terminus' and this creates a visual that if you could look very, very closely the lines begin to look like a bunch little lines cluttered and intersecting. Directionality is complicated and not well understood but it is understood well enough with some general rules to create the programs. Directionality is directly linked to "Up-Theory" and generally it is important to determine the spatial direction of the terminus for each segment for proper function. The Rate is the amount of pulses over a certain time once properly activated within a segment or line. Rate is separated into two types: resting and active. A resting rate is the pulse at any time when a particular stimuli is not in effect while the other is when that stimuli is. For instance imagine if a construct responds to a command word, when the word is spoken the active rate is determined otherwise the resting rate is present. Since constructs require a constant and steady stream of aether, to keep a frame in tact there must be a constant rate. That's why a resting rate is necessary. Lastly intensity is simply the amount of aether within each pulse.</p>

  <p><strong>Pauchik&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>There is the characteristics!</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have a favorite construct</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>A single construct or type?</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>Either</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>I have a tendency to like whatever I'm working on at the time which happens to most recently be things to communicate with you! &nbsp;I'm a specialist on communication device constructs under the classification of aetherial mechanisms.</p>
  <p>So I suppose that is my favorite!</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>You briefly mentioned an “Up-Theory”, what is that?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>oooo.... &nbsp;Save that for aetheril studies. &nbsp;It's a doozy.</p>
  <p>Also it requires a pretty big math background.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Got it</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>I for one have a pretty good background in logic but it seems more concerned with probability.</p>
  <p>Any other questions before I move onto the first type of construct?</p>
  <p>Are my lectures that clear? &nbsp;I'm a good lecturer.</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>Yes you are my little pauchik.</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Dawww</p>
  <p>Moving on!</p>

<h3>Aetherial Mechanisms</h3>
<p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
<p>The first type of construct I will discuss is Aetherial Mechanisms. These come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. The purpose of a mechanism is to be able to repeat the same thing over and over again or be used for a complex function that does not require movement from a general place in space or the casting of a spell on command. These are things like communication tools. When one thinks of enchanting an object however this is generally what they are thinking of. A sword that casts thermokinetics but has no "mind" of it's own. A device that with a command word you can create a cloud of darkness. That's right, Necromancers enchant! Don't call them enchanters however, this is a term in academia reserved for polymaths who have contributed a lot to their study. I happen to be an expert on Aetherial Mechanisms and invented programming that is more efficient to recreate for a device known as a tricky quill. An object that records as you speak. Do know however that Aetherial Mechanisms that cast on commands break down and the more difficult the casting the more likely they are to break down as people are always casting and the wave patterns of the aether always changing.</p>
<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Would it be reasonable to compare a pulse to the constructs “heartbeat”?</p>
  <p><strong>Asmo</strong></p>
  <p>I havent read much but I love it all so far!</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Would it be reasonable to compare a pulse to the constructs “heartbeat”?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If a construct had several hearts sure! &nbsp;I mean SEVERAL hearts.</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>Yes you are my little pauchik.</p>
  <p><strong>Map</strong></p>
  <p>How tall is pauchik?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>157 cm</p>
  <p>QUESTIONS?!</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>Can you give other examples of things Necromancers enchant</p>
  <p>like say, can you enchant food to boil on its own</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>All sorts of things really. &nbsp;We are problem solvers by nature making things a little easier one program at a time.</p>
  <p>I really like some enchanted light sources myself.</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>What does an enchanted light source do? Is it different from just a normal lamp</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>It doesn't use oil mainly</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have electrical lamps?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>No... &nbsp;Not where I am.</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>You live in a rural area on Dial?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Dial is a fairly new settlement but generally a lot of our technology you might find primitive.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Can/will the aetherial plane run out of aether eventually or is it infinite?</p>
  <p>If this is more aetherial studies no worries, just curious</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>If it will then I certainly don't see any real indication of it.</p>
  <p>Planar actually might be better at answering that</p>
  <p>Spatial measurements and all.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Ok thank you!</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Anything else or should I move to another construct?</p>
  <p>Okay!</p>
  <p>Which one next....</p>
  <p>Undead it is</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Undead</h3>
<p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
<p>Undead are typically what people think of when they think of Necromancers and with good reason! Our title comes from the idea we animate dead and we certainly do! I don't know a single programming specialist who hasn't animated before. Undead are much easier the create than other constructs, we work with a lot of what is already there. With that said Undead break down physically pretty fast so it's always good to have a specialist at fixing up the dead around. Someone to keep them limber and slow down the decay. Alchemists and Necromancers go hand in hand when they specialize on this cheap and efficient way to create constructs. Undead however do not make good constructs for a common person as they require so much maintenance and slowly more programming will need to be added to them to keep them functioning. Eventually they become indistinguishable from Full Frame constructs. This form of programming however has several uses. Wake Necromancers are people who animate loved ones for a proper goodbye. It is not believed that this is really the person saying goodbye so it's mostly for the loved ones. Also often a Wake Necromancer will need to make programming to assist with making the construct close to how the deceased was remembered by relying on information provided to them.</p>
<p>Undead are generally animated often during training as well.</p>
<h3>Full Frames</h3>
<p>Full Frames are the most complicated constructs of all. They require very large and elaborate frames but they are good for the manipulation of any material in space and can have a large list of commands. For defense constructs of metal can be programmed that are trained in combat and other things. These constructs however are very expensive and time consuming to create and therefore a separate craftsman is typically responsible for creating the body treating each one as a work of art. It is very rare that these are commissioned except by the government or large organizations. With that said Dial has a few such constructs that assist in defense, I even helped with some of the programming! With nothing to work off of, only masters of the craft make them.</p>
<h3>Scrolls</h3>
<p>The final type of constructs I will discuss today are Contingent Single Casters also known as scrolls. These items are made for efficient use, those casters who are not yet experts or are even novices but need to utilize a spell outside their own ability. They have instructions to act through the whole spellcasting process but are not established in a way to repeat the process. These also require maintenance in the event they have aged too long or are too complicated. Generally they do what you expect, they cast a spell with little effort, once.</p>
<p>These contructs are small frame occupying little space but they can be very complicated. As you can see constructs come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and really it just takes some imagination and ingenuity.</p>
<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Hm, would an example of a Full Frame be something like an "automated defense turret" that would have programming that differentiates ally and foe?</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>I'm also here but I dont have any questions coming to mind</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>That or a soldier of wood or steel</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>I’m listening! Had to leave the house for band practice tho</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>Is there a minimum size to scrolls? Would it be possible to, let's say, have a simple scroll that shoots out a projectile shot and you make lots of tiny ones. Would you be able to use as ammo?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>You'll have to build the spell and then find a way to create shortcuts to minimize the frame size</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Has animation ever been a controversial field on your plane?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely it has</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Makes sense</p>
  <p>Is it still?</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan</strong></p>
  <p>Do these scrolls require four points or whatever?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Generally yes except not a full four-point book. &nbsp;Their four-points are on the scroll itself.</p>
  <p>But you can also create a construct that due to having the present aether can cast without</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Generally yes except not a full four-point book. &nbsp;Their four-points are on the scroll itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Could you use the four points on the scroll for casting things other than what the scroll is intended for or would that do something bad/not work?</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan</strong></p>
  <p>Like drawing power from its own battery? (edited)</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Is it still?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>There are complicated feelings on it where you go and according to certain faiths but where I am it's generally acceptable.</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>Could you use the four points on the scroll for casting things other than what the scroll is intended for or would that do something bad/not work?</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Generally they are minimally charged and use very little material. It's just the spark to make the spell go off. &nbsp;You might be able to but it would be more efficient to use a book.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan</strong></p>
  <p>Like drawing power from its own battery? (edited)</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Sorta, yeah</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong></p>
  <p>I have to leave now, thank you so much for the lecture! It was both fascinating and enlightening</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thank you for listening!!!</p>
  <p><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
  <p>Our pleasure!</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan</strong></p>
  <p>How does a scroll interface with your perception/will, assuming it does?</p>
  <p>If I have a scroll that creates a light when I need one, would I be able to determine where that light is placed and what intensity, etc?</p>
  <p>If it were meant to create a flame to light a fire in the wilderness for campfires during travel could I instead target a creature/object in or out of the wilderness to light on fire if needed?</p>
  <p>If the scroll shoots a rock forward with thermokinetics, do I determine the direction it is shot and how much force it uses?</p>
  <p>Are any factors malleable to the person utilizing the scroll or is it exactly as the scroll intends, meaning circumstances/situations need to perfectly align with its intended use or it either won't function at all, or wouldn't work the way you need/want it to? (edited)</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>I see the scrolls are one-use. If this is the case, how easy are they to make</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>Generally the scrolls offers most of the heavy lifting but you would need to make small alterations to give other directions in specificity. &nbsp;Those types of scrolls are generally less popular for that reason.</p>
  <p>Novices use scrolls generally. &nbsp;Those who do not cast will find a lot of difficulty with them but there are some scrolls that exist that users without training can use as long as they are comfortable with the exact usage. &nbsp;These generally use a command word.</p>
  <p><strong>BowserJrXD</strong></p>
  <p>I see the scrolls are one-use. If this is the case, how easy are they to make</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>More difficult than a spell and less difficult than other constructs.</p>
  <p><strong>Chuck</strong></p>
  <p>I do have an off-topic question if you'll indulge, if you'd prefer to save it to a definitive end-of-lecture discussion then I can save it for then</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>You can ask it outside of this chat! &nbsp;I'll likely leave after lecture questions as I have something I need to take care of but I'll get back to you.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan</strong></p>
  <p>Time for the big one. With undead constructs you "work with what is already there" which is efficient compared to full frames. But they break down due to, I'm assuming, natural processes of decay... and thus degrading the materials you've attached the programming to. &nbsp;Can you program living things though? What limitations does that have in theory vs. practice.</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>A often frightening question to most but the simple answer is yes. &nbsp;The living can be programmed if they are physically still long enough.</p>
  <p><strong>Chuck</strong></p>
  <p>Sure! I've put it in Ask Pauchik</p>
  <p><strong>Pauchik</strong></p>
  <p>But it's very complicated and dangerous.</p>
  <p>If there is nothing else I'm gonna step out</p>
  <p>See you all later!</p>
