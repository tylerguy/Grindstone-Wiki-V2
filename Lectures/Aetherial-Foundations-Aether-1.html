<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From March 3rd, 2022</i></span></p>
<h3>Introductory Remarks</h3>
<p>We have discussed for several lectures as well as within different Q&amp;A sessions the idea of aether and the aetherial matrix. &nbsp;In this lecture we will be condensing some of this information and elaborating more on what the aether actually is and how it effects reality. &nbsp;We will discuss an experiment that you unfortunately will not be able to carry out but results will be described and finally we will address questions regarding the aether even those we do not yet have answers to.</p>
<p>Before I begin, much like other lectures recently I will answer questions to hopefully keep us on a similar if not the same page. This series builds on itself.</p>
<h3>Question Break</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I am accepting questions at this time. I'm certain many of you may not know what to even ask and that is okay.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>How are you doing?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Keeping productive, thank you for asking.</p>
  <p>You have 7 minutes before I return to lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Ahhh</p>
  <p>I'm trying to rack my brain for questions xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>samme</p>
  <p>trying to see if i had any questions james told me to save for aetherial lecture</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>hmm</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>What are the somatics of turning autum to spring or emerald to pearls</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>i asked about aetherial insulators at some point, do you know if those exist</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>hmmm</p>
  <p>i turned into a ruby duringa puzzle hunt once</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her: What are the somatics of turning autum to spring or emerald to pearls</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I would just ask them to change their name.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Hmm, do you know what would be the theoretical “maximum” an amount of Aether any particular caster might be able to handle? I do realize this varies from person to person but as a rough estimate for the ‘average’ I suppose</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>So no transmutation</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: i asked about aetherial insulators at some point, do you know if those exist</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This may be answered for you in this lecture.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: Hmm, do you know what would be the theoretical “maximum” an amount of Aether any particular caster might be able to handle? I do realize this varies from person to person but as a rough estimate for the ‘average’ I suppose</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Handle how?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is the aether stored in a different "place" somehow</p>
  <p>like the way it was described in lecture felt like opening a pocket somewhere</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>We know diamond disperses Aether, and we know lead absorbs Aether. Can diamond and lead disperse or absorb Aether that doesn’t overlap with it in 3D space? Or does Aether have to <i>overlap</i> with the material to be affected by it in the aforementioned manners?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>or does it exist around us just unfeelable</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>Can a person be aenionised by a act of heroism?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I suppose I mean in general spell work? Like what is the theoretical limit of what a person be able to do when doing a spell, like Aetherial exhaust</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: is the aether stored in a different "place" somehow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The aether exists within the aetherial matrix. You certainly open up the plane to the aetherial matrix through aeonization.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is that a different dimension ?</p>
  <p>5d space is very hard to visualize</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: We know diamond disperses Aether, and we know lead absorbs Aether. Can diamond and lead disperse or absorb Aether that doesn’t overlap with it in 3D space? Or does Aether have to <i>overlap</i> with the material to be affected by it in the aforementioned manners?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As I understand it, it must but lead acts like a sponge as though the aether is almost attracted to it. Something we will elaborate on.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her: Can a person be aenionised by a act of heroism?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do not understand.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her: Can a person be aenionised by a act of heroism?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can become aeonized by either too much exposure to the aether, or having someone use a spell to aeonize you.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Long term health effects are an ongoing study, but generally you can expect ulcers and tumors from what I hear.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her:&nbsp;So no transmutation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Transmutation is a concept in alchemy.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: is that a different dimension ?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Aetherial matrix is a 5D structure I believe, imagine planes as 5D structures that are subsets of the 5D universe. Everything that’s not in a plane is in the Aetherial matrix, I am very sure, anyways.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: I suppose I mean in general spell work? Like what is the theoretical limit of what a person be able to do when doing a spell, like Aetherial exhaust</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Technically as long as something can be summated and programmed fast enough spells can continue to be larger or more complex although there are limitations to sapient species and so it is hard to say though ritual casting is limited to 13 participants.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: 5d space is very hard to visualize</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I recommend instead visualizing 2 dimensions using the disk model.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>disk model? is that the hourglass</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Personally I’m still unsure on the geometry of accessing the Aetherial matrix from within the plane, if there exists a neighborhood in 5D space about you that does not intersect the matrix.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: disk model? is that the hourglass</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is not, the hourglass only partially explains the universe.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>my visualization was like a 2d hourglass containing 3d planes but im not really sure if that's how dimensions works</p>
  <p>ok can you describe the disk model</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Flatten out reality and consider it a disk with center point being ring 8. Within the disk are amorphous and ever changing areas with semi-rigid but mostly fluid like boarders. The area between these, all of the area like a sea, is the aether.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: Technically as long as something can be summated and programmed fast enough spells can continue to be larger or more complex although there are limitations to sapient species and so it is hard to say though ritual casting is limited to 13 participants.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Good to know!</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>Urbarra said something about the self mending of the holes one makes for a spell. Can you explain the basic for that? What heals it and what would keep it open without a active involvement of a caster</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>so like the dark blue is a ring and the light blue is aether?</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949125077734150174/unknown.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Oh! Do you if Aether has a structure? Like if it’s a molecule or a wave or something</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: so like the dark blue is a ring and the light blue is aether?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Not quite. Instead imagine hundreds of these areas sprinkled about of varying sizes.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>by these areas you mean the dark blue</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: Oh! Do you if Aether has a structure? Like if it’s a molecule or a wave or something</li>
  </ul>
  <p>ah yes the particle or wave question</p>
  <p>and also are the dark blue areas rings? or planes?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: ah yes the particle or wave question</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>Cries in quantum. But is in superposition of crying and not.</i></p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her: Urbarra said something about the self mending of the holes one makes for a spell. Can you explain the basic for that? What heals it and what would keep it open without a active involvement of a caster</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only aeonization at a weak zone such as an active caster would open these holes though some appear naturally.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>crying when unobserved and not crying when observed</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: Oh! Do you if Aether has a structure? Like if it’s a molecule or a wave or something</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is the very beginning of our lecture tonight.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Oh awesome xD</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: and also are the dark blue areas rings? or planes?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rings are uniform and are generalizations based on characteristics and rate of time dilation which accelerates.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949126279595163668/unknown.png"></figure>
  <p>ok so i was too lazy to draw dots</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, much better.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>in the rest of the rings</p>
  <p>so would the black lines be rings or the space between the lines</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are points of a greater density of planes and those without. For instance Ring 4 and Ring 1 have larger amounts of small planes also rings beyond 8 are the Other Side and there is very limited information on them.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ooh planes have size</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>In addition to planes there are anomolies that are studied. Things we know are there but are not planes themselves. They are usually completely rigid.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>so dark blue are planes, light blue is aether</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blaise: Only aeonization at a weak zone such as an active caster would open these holes though some appear naturally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How densely populated is a area with these weak holes</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The size in this instance is mapped in the 4th and 5th dimension.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>how do you measure those dimensions</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her: How densely populated is a area with these weak holes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Weak zones form for a number of reasons but typically a weak zone is simply present with the aid of a 4-point.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: so dark blue are planes, light blue is aether</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: how do you measure those dimensions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By looking into existing qualities of planes. This however is a Planar question.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>And exactly my specialty!</p>
  <p>We can talk sometime after lecture on this Emerald.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh cool</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>Ah a portable weak hole...... ill shutup now</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Anything else?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I'm good I think!</p>
  <p><strong>FireWizard in a Blizzard She/Her</strong></p>
  <p>Next chapter please</p>

<h3>Aether</h3>
<p>We will begin with the obvious, what is the aether? The aether is an amaterial that exists in space 5-dimensionally outside of existing planes and its absence allows for the movement or stretching of the 4th and 5th dimensional space of planes. Over years we have tried to quantify intensity of aether and determine a way of measuring it. Different units exist for the measurement of the intensity of the aether but the smallest relevant measurement given current technology has been described as a singular packet of aether. While a packet is not a practical means of measuring aether it does lend to understanding the theory and properties of the aether. Outside of quantitative anlysis of aether we recognize qualities of aether including the uniqueness of charge. Aether has 3 charge characteristics and each attract, repel, or act inert depending on the relationship with the other.</p>
<p>The aether moves constantly within the aetherial matrix. Some areas with predictable currents while other much more random movement is observed. Part of this is due to the three charges of aether and their interaction. Accumulation is when movement by charge forces a large drift of aether creating something of a wave. Since aether is amaterial you would call it a massless particle as well. Over limitless time one might think the aether would eventually settle and have a regular pattern of push and pull put due to the complexity of overlays, casting, aetherial exhaust, position of planes, and anomalies the movement of the aetherial matrix is very complex. For this reason and the expectations of time dilation it is much easier to summate aether near to your position and account for very large and regular currents of aether. Unfortunately there are times when these are not even reliable to be "mostly right" which any caster hopes for. This is why theories have been developed to determine bad times and positions of casting though most do not have much credibility.</p>
<p>I will break for questions</p>
<h3>Question Break and Discourse</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Is amaterial different from immaterial</p>
  <p>Wait is a packet a fixed size?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: Wait is a packet a fixed size?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's theoretical</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ok</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Does Aether have a range? Like, does it decay to something after traveling a characteristic distance?</p>
  <p>No wait then how would the matrix be filled.</p>
  <p>Hm.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>I got this one. Something that is material would be as you say to have mass characteristics. There is also amaterial, nonmaterial, and immaterial.</p>
  <p>The amaterial is something that mass-less in characteristic. The immaterial is something the suggest towards or approaches meaning it has partial characteristics. The last is nonmaterial which is honestly a cheap way of saying it isn't material and kinda hooky as shit, technical term.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Could you elaborate for them what you mean by that?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Yes but not in a real practical time for lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what are partial characteristics</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>To use some religious studies terms, they aren't perfect.</p>
  <p>I saw you typing name.</p>
  <p>Take a swing at this.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I guess to elaborate on perfect, that means the immaterial does not encompass all of the characteristics of material. In set theoretic language, A is perfectly B if B is a subset of A, and A is beautifully B if A is no more than B, yeah?</p>
  <p>I guess I was just elaborating a bit on the terms based on how they were defined before.</p>
  <p>The set theoretic language works well for me if I take properties as the elements of these sets.</p>
  <p>Like Venn diagram stuff.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Petition to add latex bot just so we can use the fancy set notation when discussing perfection and beauty</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Using crude terms then tell me what im-matter is.</p>
  <p>What is a latex bot?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>You said the immaterial approaches partial meaning? Did ya mean they partially approach the status of material?</p>
  <p>Just to dissect the message.</p>
  <p>LaTex bots allow us to type math and make it pretty.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Ok so material has a set of characteristics. So if immaterial isn’t perfect, then material has characteristics that immaterial doesn’t have</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: You said the immaterial approaches partial meaning? Did ya mean they partially approach the status of material?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>I got tripped up with the perfect definition I think</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: Ok so material has a set of characteristics. So if immaterial isn’t perfect, then material has characteristics that immaterial doesn’t have</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also correct</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949135120466575430/205785226180427776.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Nice</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>That’s what a LaTex bot outputs.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Pretty</p>
  <p>Useful for both set notation and just emphasis</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>That might be useful for charge notation if we really get into the math of the theory sometime.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Also formulas in math.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I may need to split this lecture in two with the experiment in the second half. You can continue to answer questions however Urbarra<sup>[1]</sup></p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>imagine using this as a reaction</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949135515490353152/hfcapgar.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ResearcherUrbarra: Correct</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So I guess yeah, in crude terms, the immaterial has properties that overlap with the material, but doesn’t fully match up.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>so also immaterial could have properties that material doesn't?</p>
  <p>neither perfect nor beautiful?</p>
  <p>or still beautiful</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>I didn't distinguish but that is an important consideration in the study of RAoBL. Though the short answer is, it isn't clear</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>qwhats that</p>
  <p>A is perfectly B if: $A - B$ is empty set.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>nicee</p>
  <p><strong>TeXit</strong></p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949136378384510986/205785226180427776.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I… I forgot the command.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>A is perfectly B if: $A - B = { }$</p>
  <p><strong>TeXit</strong></p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892114420589817877/949136469430251541/422568788182171649.png"></figure>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>like that?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>That works too.</p>
  <p>I was looking for 0 with a slash.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh yeah idk that</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Relative Abstractions of Belthidian Law which I always hated the term because there is no abstraction of Belthidian Law. It is uniform and unwavering, we just don't have a grasp on it yet.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>by not having a grasp on it, does that mean you know the laws but not what they mean?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are religious texts that describe some but simply characterize the laws as numerous.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So imprecise language?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Basically. Blaise is more familiar with the religious studies of it which the Toristic does overlap.</p>
  <p>But even then the Toristic is based on empiricism. We simply do not know and we don't know what we don't know.</p>
  <p>That is why a lot of us do though.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>so if you were to discover a new law, could it possibly be belthidian</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>I would test the law across planes and remember, defining a law is like defining a natural law in your world except it has to hold up universally.</p>
  <p>It isn't easy.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>So extra-planar experiments can narrow down Belthidian Laws, but we won’t know exactly unless we try every possible plane?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are there any famous laws on our plane that are belhidian</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>So how would one know how much of the Aether can they influence without injuries, considering that it is constantly in flux? I'm not too sure if influence is the right word for it but I couldn't think of a better one.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: So extra-planar experiments can narrow down Belthidian Laws, but we won’t know exactly unless we try every possible plane?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Good question. The Belthidian laws define how the natural laws differ for the most part. This is a very tricky idea.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dhruv the Quiet: So how would one know how much of the Aether can they influence without injuries, considering that it is constantly in flux? I'm not too sure if influence is the right word for it but I couldn't think of a better one.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you begin drawing aether early in your career you typically have someone who can assist you with the process starting very, very small so as to not injure yourself. You'll learn quickly your own capabilities for the manipulation and programming of aether. You do get better at it. Those who are aetherial efferent casters will routinely do small tests to determine the ebb and flow of the aetherial matrix in preferred space for casting every morning using very minor summation. The short answer is you try to build up and not overwhelm yourself.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Alright don't go full send into it got it</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Slightly off topic, or not, I guess it refers to Planar geometries, did you manage to take a look at my questions in internal yet? I guess it might also relate to the sizes of planes that was brought up earlier.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>If you read internal I have just started!</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh.</p>
  <p>Lovely!</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>There are unique characteristics of your planar geometry and aetherial wave characteristics that distracted me for a time in my assisting of other Project Grindstone responsibilities.</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>I see. So there is no specific general limit. Follow up question. Can different locations have aether with slightly differing properties? As in some spots the aether is less turbulent or more, or more malleable, or it resists manipulation?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>The limit of how to do it without safety is determined by your ability to summate. As for locations do you mean within the aetherial matrix? If so then absolutely. One of the aforementioned interesting properties of your plane is the turbulent qualities of the aetherial wave patterns.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>So the aetherial matrix near our plan is wack and crazy Aether nice</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>Alright. So the locations could make the programming easier or more difficult right? So optimal locations could be compared to our world's idea of Ley lines and related convergence points?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Turbulent in terms of wave patterns, or is there something about its structural composition too? Seems like spells have an issue being programmed here.</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>Oh yes that is also one which I wanted to ask about.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Programming remains about the same but the summation especially difficult making the even start of casting dangerous here.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p><s>I’m still super curious about all the how’s and stuffs about the whole Aether manipulation/casting process xD</s></p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: Turbulent in terms of wave patterns, or is there something about its structural composition too? Seems like spells have an issue being programmed here.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The wave patterns though the programming is different somehow.</p>
  <p>We have however been able to verify the process of aeonization does work here.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Interesting. Does programming rely on wave patterns too? Like if I understand correctly, our natural laws, when experiencing Aether or certain wave properties and such, cause the spell to actualize, yeah? Like a certain pattern can make a fireball.</p>
  <p>Is it believed that the wave patterns affect the programming <i>and</i> summation?</p>
  <p>Programming is what I’m most hazy on, so sorry if it’s widely off the mark.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>wait whats actualizing</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>The result</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Actualization’s just a personal word I use.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>And be successful I suppose</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>But yeah, the result more or less.</p>
  <p>Like you actualize fire if you perform a combustion reaction.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: Interesting. Does programming rely on wave patterns too? Like if I understand correctly, our natural laws, when experiencing Aether or certain wave properties and such, cause the spell to actualize, yeah? Like a certain pattern can make a fireball. Is it believed that the wave patterns affect the programming <i>and</i> summation?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They do not as far as we know. We believe the alteration to programming is due to location and the interactions of both anomalies and satellite planes.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Satellite planes? So like planes that are nearby and affect our plane in some way?</p>
  <p>I’m just making sure I’m understanding correctly xD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>bruh its like a solar system</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>How do nearby planes and anomalies affect programming on our own plane?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: bruh it's like a solar system</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Vel Blackwood</span>.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Or maybe it’s too broad a question.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>What I hope to do is produce a hypothesis using the existing data I have on casting according to characteristics of planes, their geometry, and the surrounding of planes also in relative space to ring 8 to be tested in aiding our understanding of why casting differs. I am, if you would, making an educated guess on how to program a spell.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>my first thought after satellite was what if you made a plane</p>
  <p>can you make a plane?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: I’m just making sure I’m understanding correctly xD</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Very near</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>How is programming done? Is it like done by feel or is it more like a logical process</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: How do nearby planes and anomalies affect programming on our own plane?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will get there, there is still a lot of background.</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>Aye, fair.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>do planes attract or repel each other ? is there like a 5d gravity thing?</p>
  <p>im getting the feeling that the aetherial lecture turned into a planar q&amp;a</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>So sad</p>
  <p>But this kind of topic of “what is Aether” does relate a lot of the planes and everything</p>
  <p>As they swim around in it</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: do planes attract or repel each other ? is there like a 5d gravity thing?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Neither, they fill space, kinda.</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>But yeah, what is programming? Is it just, like, how Aether with specific wave characteristics directly interact with our plane’s natural laws to create an effect?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Like by our natural laws, Aether with a certain frequency, wavelength, amplitude, would become a fireball?</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>programming is weird and i feel like i don't actually know much about it</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <p>According to Blaise the question what is programming is the very topic of the last lecture of the series he is on.</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>Oh interesting.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>ooh ok</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <p>The last survey topic of aetherial studies.</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>Seems like we have a bit of a way to go.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>can we know what all the survey lecture topics are</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>From what I remember (idk it if it helps) but I know stuff from our understanding of how computer programming works with a dash of electromagnetism helps in understanding the topics</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>like a syllabus or something</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <p>I don't really have them, I just asked Blaise about the aetherial studies lectures since he was starting the new series today.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: like a syllabus or something</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There will be something like that after the survey topics though it'll be more like a schedule than a syllabus.</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p>getting through the lectures will take a while</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <p>We can't obviously teach you everything but you can pick what you learn and ask plenty of questions as more staff comes along.</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>But what if I want to learn everything D:</p>
  <p>Dhruv the Quiet</p>
  <p>The aether reminds me about dark matter. It exists but we can't really interact with it. It is supposedly the matter that fills all the empty space in the universe so I see some obvious parllels.</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: getting through the lectures will take a while</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Isn't that true of your educational system too?</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>unfortunately</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>So long, so inefficient :pensive:</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I think to think getting through lectures takes a super long time regardless of time place or plane xD</p>
  <p>ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>Of our educational system anyways, this is way better.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>if you go to the outside rings it will take relatively less time</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I wish I could learn it all through osmosis</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>i think</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: if you go to the outside rings it will take relatively less time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rings closer to 8</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>this is fun because i choose to do it</p>
  <p>ok is 8 the center?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Correct</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what ring are we on again</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>1</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Far away~</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>Though don't think of us as the edge of the universe</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are there negative rings</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>evidence suggests a 0, -1, and -2</p>
  <p>It could go further.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ooh yes</p>
  <p>and there are fractional rings also</p>
  <p>ok great its number system time</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Oh is there such a concept of anti-Aether, similar to what we have of like anti-matter?</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>I'm unfortunately no expert on anti-matter though I have read several articles on it.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Anti-matter is matter but you negate all of the quantum numbers, hm… ah, gluons in our plane have three color charges, and anti-gluons have three anti-color charges.</p>
  <p>Maybe anti-Aether would be three anti-charges?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ah that didn't make sense</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>Similar to that question, is the aether made up of other substances? like ho matter itself is made up of quarks? Also does the aether have mass?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>It makes sense to me xD</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>At best I would say I know about as much of your physics as maybe young graduate in your US system.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>But understandable</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>yea physics did not teach me about gluons or three color charges</p>
  <p>i knoew they're like elementary particles?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Of high school or college/university?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Basically anti-matter on our plane means a reaction between matter and anti-matter, if they annihilate, yields particles that are absolutely “neutral” I guess. Photons in our plane.&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>emerald: i knoew they're like elementary particles?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That they are, what we call bosons.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ap physics 1</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>The Higgs boson is my favorite</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dhruv the Quiet: Similar to that question, is the aether made up of other substances? like ho matter itself is made up of quarks? Also does the aether have mass?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not know if Aether can be broken down further. We are limited in our understanding.</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>I see.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>The Standard Model is a mess but we appreciate it.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p><s>now I kinda want to know what would happen if we used aetherial casting to blast a hole in the Higgs field xD</s></p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <p>Mine too! It is such a fascinating topic.</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Is… is that possible?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>Probably lots of death</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>where do yall learn that? ap physics 2??</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I mean it would be like turning matter back into pure energy?</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>Oh. By hole you probably meant annihilate Higgs bosons.</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: <s>now I kinda want to know what would happen if we used aetherial casting to blast a hole in the Higgs field xD</s></li>
  </ul>
  <p><s>Particles will have no mass so they will move with the speed of light and destroy anything in their path maybe?</s></p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I thought you meant messing up the Higgs potential.</p>
  <p><s>I wish I took AP Physics.</s></p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>When I was younger I used to bing read all the science books and particles</p>
  <p>Articles but I saw the pun and took it</p>
  <p>XD</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Nice</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>I learned what I did through several articles provided to me off plane</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I took two or three online courses in middle school, I guess.</p>
  <p><strong>ResearcherUrbarra</strong></p>
  <p>There are large gaps in my understanding though.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Middle school 0-O</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I like to think I know a bit of physics, so maybe I can help? Earlier in the Project, applicants were asked to provide definitions of some things. So something like that?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I just wish I had the money and time to take all the university courses D:</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>I wish university wasn’t a scam to force us to work our way outta student debt :man_shrugging:</p>
  <p><strong>Dhruv the Quiet</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]: I just wish I had the money and time to take all the university courses D:</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I know right?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>ThisIsAName0: I wish university wasn’t a scam to force us to work our way outta student debt :man_shrugging:</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That too</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Yes both</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>It’s totally not like there is a university out there who let senior citizens take college level courses for like 5-20 USD but younger students still need to pay full tuition out there or anything <i>eye twitches</i></p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>If this were a perfect world, knowledge would be disseminated without cost or issue.</p>
  <p>But yeah you know the story.</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</strong></p>
  <p>I agree but I feel we’re straying xD</p>
  <p><strong>ThisIsAName0</strong></p>
  <p>That we are.</p>
  <p>Dhruv the Quiet</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dhruv the Quiet: Similar to that question, is the aether made up of other substances? like ho matter itself is made up of quarks? Also does the aether have mass?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So do we know if the aether has some mass?</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>The lecture called aether a massless particle :)</p>
  <p>Dhruv the Quiet</p>
  <p>Right but does the aether 'field' have mass, not just the aether.</p>
  <p>ResearcherUrbarra</p>
  <p>Again this is tricky. We base our understanding on what we can observe.</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I wonder how Aether and gravity interact :thinking:</p>
  <p>emerald</p>
  <p>If aether is massless it wouldn’t right?</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>Not necessarily! Gravity affects time and space which don’t inherently have mass</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Quick question (I’m gonna read through all of this when I take notes later), what does amaterial mean exactly? Couldn’t find anything on it on the web</p>
  <p>Does it simply mean “non-material” as in non-tangible?</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>if gravity can be the result of a black hole and theoretically punches a whole in spacetime, gravity might have some kind of impact on Aether, I kinda think of it as different state of which energy could be in</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>I’m imagining a “sinkhole” of aether from a black hole :0 theorizing is fun</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I kinda wonder if black holes would work as a giant Aether summation process or if it would do the inverse (pump Aether out and not into the plane)</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Wormhole = aether highway?</p>
  <p>:thinking:</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I suppose a white hole would be pumping Aether into the plane I guess :thinking:</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Interesting</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>No, a wormhole is a hole in space! It’s a fold in space so two places very very far away could be reached with a single step xD</p>
  <p>So it’s more like an everything highway xD</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Fair lol</p>
  <p>Amaterial things are so complicated</p>
  <p>Dhruv the Quiet</p>
  <p>So wormholes could direct some of the aether to a location that might have a lower density?</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I wouldn’t know how a wormhole works in the aetherial matrix, but I suppose a summation could be a warm hole from out plane into the aetherial matrix :thinking:</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Assuming that the aetherial matrix has areas of high and low pressure, if a bunch of aether was moved from one spot to another very quickly (via summation or wormhole maybe?) what would happen? Aetherial exhaust?</p>
  <p>I might be thinking of it too similarly to liquid or gas which both have mass</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>I don’t understand Aether enough to give a good guess xD</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>I suppose aether is a lot more complicated than that xD</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>But I think aetherial exhaust is like extra Aether at the end of a spell (or an in complete spell)</p>
  <p>Kaydo</p>
  <p>Ahh</p>
  <p>I see</p>
  <p>Welp I think that’s enough magic physics for tonight, gn!</p>
  <p>TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>Don’t quote me though I could be misremembering xD</p>
  <p>But have a good night!</p>
