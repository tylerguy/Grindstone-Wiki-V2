<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>From November 8, 2021 ~Part 3 of an ongoing Lecture</i></span></p>
<p>After a slight delay I am here for a final lecture until processing has concluded.</p>
<p>Today we will be finishing the gross geography of the continent where Belthas is located. After this we will discuss landmarks and unique geography but I highly encourage questions as I know there is not nearly enough time to cover all existing major landmarks. We will focus on places of interest decided by you.</p>
<p>I understand there was some confusion last lecture about the boarders of Victoria. I will clarify this today as well.</p>
<h4>Victoria</h4>
<p>Much like Belthas there is a peninsula, although much less pronounced, in the far South West within Victoria that has the most Western settlement on the continent Bordeaux which at the edge of town the constant storm can sometimes be seen. Seven of the central territories, The North, and Oudste all can be found on the boarder of Victoria. Victoria and Belthas are the two largest known countries.</p>
<p>The capital of Victoria is located North of the Wetlands Latitude just north of Tranquil on the edge of the largest lake Victoria has total ownership of. To the far North West however is the largest of the lakes in the continent with a small collection of islands two of which have dense forests and are claimed by Victoria but the Northern waters are often contested.</p>
<h4>The Blightlands</h4>
<p>The Blightlands four major nations but due to radical factions the exact boarder is often contested. This place is rich in rivers and has several smaller major lakes scattered within. For now these nations will remain unnamed however the far west nation is the smallest and is bordered by three central territories with the farthest South Eastern central territory also being part of the boarder to the most central and largest of the nations in the Blightlands. The border of these two nations are created by a major river that feeds into one of the smaller major rivers that is shared by the South Eastern most central territory and the two nations aforementioned in the Blightlands. Rivers also form boarders with the Eastern most, central, and Southern most nations. The southern most nation forms a boot like shape often called the Cuff and is where much trade with the blightlands takes place through the loop. North of the cuff is a large island that hosts two recognizable settlements with a sister island directly to its South West. (edited)</p>
<p>The Eastern Nation shares a boarder with Belthas with another major lake that takes a fat crescent shape with small collections of islands within. North West of the Eastern Blightlands nation is a place the blight hardly effects. This place is referred to as No Mans Land and Belthas does not recognize any owner of this land.</p>
<p>We will at this time not elaborate on the Far North and thus conclude gross geography of the continent.</p>
<h4>Questions</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Is there anything of note in regards to "weirds" in the regions you've described this far?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There are several weirds. Where in particular?</p>
  <p><strong>Kaydo</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>What is a “wierd”?</p>
  <p><strong>Blasie</strong></p>
  <p>A weird is a wooded area that is anomalous. This might mean Oberidian involvement, strange painting on trees, unusual weather, many different possibilities. There is even talk of weirds that have constant overlays. Weirds are of particular interest to Cultural Studies Field Researchers but sometimes Planar Studies is involved.</p>
  <p><i>There is littl</i>e I can elaborate on in regards to the blightlands but could you be more specific in regards to Victoria since it is one of the largest nations on the continent?</p>
  <p>I can begin just listing weirds in general.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>what is tranquil?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Tranquil is a condition and a place.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>can you list the countries on the border of victoria in order starting from the most northeast and curving around southwards</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>The North, Oudste, Evigstande, Nombrepuer, Zontanera, Mezzomond, Hlyri Lond, Spitoutheo / Tomerkansp, Autarky&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mammoth Grave and Beauteous Grove are both weirds in Victoria. Those are two of several examples</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>are there any weirds on other planes such as <a href="/Info/EXT-111">ext-111</a>?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>We do not classify them as such, no.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>would your earlier mentioned "No Man's Land" qualify as a weird?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's contested currently but is considered one.</p>
  <p>Silver Blood is also a weird in Victoria.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mammoth Grave is a strange place where large warm blooded creatures travel to in the horrible cold to die.</p>
  <p>Beauteous Grove, a place with lots of holes into the subterra and full of aberrant hives. It is named because of that, and the affiliation with Offalmaw who many consider the reason behind the conceptual awareness/discovery of Beauty.</p>
  <p>The blightlands is almost entirely tropic with only a very small portion connecting with the grain belt latitude near the West/Center and the East.</p>
  <p>Belthas has the Feathered Grotto, Direwoods, Story Oak, and Copse of Calm as weird examples.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Copse of Calm?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's been described as disturbingly quiet there. Even wild animals just don't make noises, as if on instinct. Even the wind seems still.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Do you have any extremely large mountains? I've seen in past lectures that there's a fair amount of ranges, but are there named ones?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>We do have notably large mountains.</p>
  <p>I'm assuming you are wanting to know about our largest mountain?</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Ideally, yes. And is their a confirmed height number?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's not often someone attempts climbing the mountain so I'd say no.</p>
  <p><strong>Sir Gruffles</strong></p>
  <p>Fair enough! But what's it's name?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Donderspleet</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>do topos khazak and oudste border no man's land</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>No, it is a very small space between the Blightlands and Mountains. The border is oudste, the BLightlands, and very nearly Belthas by only maybe a dozen barrow or so.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan Clownin</strong></p>
  <p>So a saltwater lake was mentioned last lecture... What's up with that?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>Yes, Remeus' Fault.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan Clownin</strong></p>
  <p>Is it Rameus or Remeus 'cause I keep seeing both used.</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>It's habit. For those raised in the North East it's often written one way opposed to others. Pronounced the same either way but officially recognized with an "a"</p>
  <p>So Rameus' Fault.</p>
  <p>It is a saltwater lake located in the west wetlands. It was created during the revolution.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan Clownin</strong></p>
  <p>Why? Were there not better things to build during a war?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>There is still much not understood about the magics that led to this at the Battle of Redfield.</p>
