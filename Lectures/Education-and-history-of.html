<h3><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Hello every and welcome.&nbsp; To our first lecture here.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit I missed while I was away I see!</p>
<p>Many, many new faces.</p>
<p>It's been quite some time since I've had to give a lecture and I don't think I've ever needed to over a medium that was simply text so my apologies in advance.</p>
<p>As you all should know I'm Bruno Gelehrte and I'm the head of the Cultural Research Department here at the Universal Magical Academy at Dial.&nbsp; The format of this lecture will have me providing information, then taking questions, then returning to lecture, and repeating.&nbsp; There will be time at the end of this lecture for general lecture questions and even talk about the next topic!</p>
<p>For now however I will be talking on Education and the History of.</p>
<p>I have some prepared script but will also type out here additional comments as we progress.&nbsp; Once I provide my initial script I will wait 5 minutes and then move to lecture-questions.</p>
<p>With all this said I will open with a question.&nbsp; Are we all ready to begin?</p>
<p>Very well!</p>
<h3><strong><u>First Section - Early Education and Orders</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Like your world the systems of education in our world took a very long time to develop and their history a very complicated web.&nbsp; Even now there are several systems that can be considered educational institutions.&nbsp; Beyond this every country seems to have it's own standards and practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the ideal place to begin is chronologically the earliest I can and work forward to the present.&nbsp; The sapient materialfolk have been securing our own safety and advancement through the education of others since the most primitive technology.&nbsp; We began through oral warning of dangers including where predators might be to what not to eat.&nbsp; Not long after the earliest civilizations began to develop and primitive written word was conceptualized we began needing systems to learn how to transcribe text.&nbsp; The earliest texts required years to master and this meant time that was not spent in labor so religious leaders and governors of communities often had access to education while others took to learning trades of their parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This system suited the early people fine until societies became ever more complex and cultural integration became just as much a tactic territory control as warfare was.&nbsp; The early temples were the first to adopt new systems of education forming monasteries that aided by providing increased income beyond tithe.&nbsp; These isolated communities were the ideal place to develop ideas and early technology.&nbsp; With the option to provide services outside of the products manufactured in these monasteries many temples wished to seize the opportunity for additional revenue but recognized the risk to the culture of monasteries by having those whom left, under the permission of those who governed in exchange for divine favor, their local lands for a new life and community.&nbsp; This issue would soon be rectified with the advent of Castra Fidei.&nbsp; These were places created to train artisans for hire but also house newly acquired resources for the temples under the protection of their own private forces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest Orders were permitted to co-exist often but it did not take long until local governors gained increase concern for the military power growing in their own lands.&nbsp; This was exacerbated during early land seizures in what is now the Central Territories for religious dominance.&nbsp; It would be almost a century however until strict alternative systems would be put into place and before that the wealthy would hire religious scholars and other experts to be the educators of their young.&nbsp; During the early Imperial Era of the Azalt Emperor Zephastus commanded the creation of a secular order for the education of aetherial use.&nbsp; He feared the ever growing presence of religious Orders and commissioned a taxable and more controllable Order.&nbsp; The newly established order was intended to be a political instrument and extension of the military while also being without a divine commitment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Emperor those concerned with the eternal in his court had him assassinated before a temporal Order could be established.&nbsp; With the policies only partially established a deal conducted with a temple those in power felt they could trust everything seemed back in motion.&nbsp; The Order of The Magus was established but in their creation their first leading entity the Arch Magus announced it's secularity in so far as separation from the temple of Belthid but with Belthidian ideologies and to exist as an apolitical entity.&nbsp; It's believed that this decision is what led to a later ruler's support of some of the first religious reform acts.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Questions are open.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>"The sapient materialfolk have been securing our own safety and advancement"</p>
<p>-This line, along with what little we've seen of your world (including an image of Obelus appearing to be in a barren wasteland) implies some sort of external threat or danger? Does the term post-apocalypse mean much to you and would you say it's an adequate term for your world's condition?</p>
<p>"our own" also implies without the aid or benefit of the divine, which strikes me as curious since gods seem to be a very critical component to your world and an implied active force within it...</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>I would not say we are in such a state.&nbsp; What I mean by this is adapting to survive during a primitive era.&nbsp; Not too unlike your kind as I understand it.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> "our own" also implies without the aid or benefit of the divine, which strikes me as curious since gods seem to be a very critical component to your world and an implied active force within it...</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>There is communion and connection but I would not go so far to say they are very active.&nbsp; Also there is always a need for secular developments like philosophy and technology.</p>
<p><br><strong>Amphithere Majesticon</strong></p>
<p>On extension of above, it is mentioned that the "materialfolk" has been securing things. This implies there is energyfolk or something other than material, what is this? Alongside this, is there non-sapient materialfolk?</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>The materialfolk is a general term meaning all the sapient species of our world such as Rau, Val, Human, Orc, etc.</p>
<p>Aside from Vel who I see typing is there anyone else who has questions before I move on?</p>
<p><br><strong>Vel Blackwood</strong></p>
<p>did leaders of religious orders slowly increase in power over time as to control the land as kingdoms instead of as helping the people</p>
<p><br><strong>TheShades</strong></p>
<p>Since we're talking education, have any leaders tried to use education as a form of Propganda for their own agenda? And has anything been done to curtail that in present time? It's an issue we deal with here and now.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Vel Blackwood</strong> did leaders of religious orders slowly increase in power over time as to control the land as kingdoms instead of as helping the people</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>This is a tricky question.&nbsp; Self-advancement is the domain of Anankaia but it seems most have wants for self advancement as part of their nature.&nbsp; There were those who did use the church to amass land to establish theocracy but these are not universal.&nbsp; Perhaps I could have specific lectures in the future on the history of some nations.&nbsp; Rise, fall, acquisition, and reformation of them.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@TheShades</strong> Since we're talking education, have any leaders tried to use education as a form of Propganda for their own agenda? And has anything been done to curtail that in present time? It's an issue we deal with here and now.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Communication technologies continue to develop like anywhere else.&nbsp; With this said I think my previous answer is applicable to more than just the temples.</p>
<p>Anything else before we continue?</p>
<p>Very well!<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Second Section - The Rise of the Academia</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Near the end of the Imperial Era of the Azalt lived a man by the name of Academus whose land would be worked into a place of reflection shortly after his death.&nbsp; Academus was a farmer and a man of little importance to history aside from what he left behind.&nbsp; The place of reflection was crafted using monies earned by his son as an educator.&nbsp; He referred to this place of study and reflection his Academia.&nbsp; Legend has it, it's because that is where his father was buried.&nbsp; While the name of this educator is lost to history his greatest student Tor would set in motion a new way of thinking and discovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it's establishment the cost of attending lecture at the Academia was simply the cost to sustain it and therefore many of those with the interest of further their education attended.&nbsp; Due to its position in the world and the peaceful time many soldiers often found their way to the Academia.&nbsp; The existing Emperor was fearful of another order being established close to where he ruled but also saw the Academia as a opportunity that could not be ignored.&nbsp; He proclaimed Tor a brilliant mind and built upon the Academia to supply other minds, his students, access to resources for the betterment of his nation.&nbsp; The Academia was a Order for the nation in many ways. The Academia did not last but a few years however but that is not relevant to this lecture.</p>
<p>I will be taking a moment for questions in the next 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Please note this is a very brief survey.&nbsp; I could elaborate on any point in future lectures or by questions.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>What would specifically separate an academy from an order?</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Is this related to the "brilliant mind" Tor just mentioned?</p>
<p>https://discord.com/channels/860257333246165034/875978274562539550/876225852902371388</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Chuck [any/all]</strong> What would specifically separate an academy from an order?</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>I'm now open for questions.&nbsp; You're getting a little ahead of me on the lecture Chuck!&nbsp; I will be addressing this actually.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Oh nice</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Is this related to the "brilliant mind" Tor just mentioned?&nbsp; https://discord.com/channels/860257333246165034/875978274562539550/876225852902371388</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Why yes, it is the very same Tor.</p>
<p><br><strong>Emrys [They/Him]</strong></p>
<p>was there any resistance to the pursuit of knowledge within academia from any groups, for example religious groups as we have had in our world?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Emrys [They/Him]</strong> was there any resistance to the pursuit of knowledge within academia from any groups, for example religious groups as we have had in our world?</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately this has happened for us in the past especially shortly after the fall of the Azalt.</p>
<p>There is a more recent account in the West however with the establishment of a denomination of Kadmin based on the ideologies of Helshia.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>What caused the fall of the Azalt? How long ago did that take place.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> What caused the fall of the Azalt? How long ago did that take place.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Also a complicated question as it depends on who you ask what the official "fall" of the Azalt was.&nbsp; Unfortunately this might need to be a lecture for another time.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>So it's like the fall of Rome, or America.</p>
<p>Dying in stages.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Any other questions before I proceed?</p>
<p>Understood!<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Third Section - Education Under Othello</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>More than a century after the loss of Academia the Eastern Kingdom that would become the Kingdom of Othello began to establish itself.&nbsp; Religious education transformed over the century to house a third option, the temple.&nbsp; The temple itself became a place of local education for youths that were not acquired for the peoples tax or were too young at the time according to the local lord.&nbsp; This is why many small communities often have only a few faiths they practice if not just one.&nbsp; Religion and what faiths might practice were often restricted by local lords within the Old Kingdom.&nbsp; The people's tax was established so the king could control the flow and training of artisans to help regulate power between the other lords with and without peerage.&nbsp; The model allowed for the training of artisans by the nation, simple education to the youth, and aetherial education to still be regulated by The Order of the Magus which persisted all this time.&nbsp; While it was illegal in the Old Kingdom to receive aetherial education outside the order illegal casters were often "overlooked" out of convenience.&nbsp; It wasn't until after the revolution and the removal of the people's tax that new systems became necessary.</p>
<p>Some of you can probably guess where this is headed by now.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Taking questions while I draft the next part</p>
<p><br><strong>Vel Blackwood</strong></p>
<p>Was the revolution a populous uprising or was a power struggle from within the kingdom itself</p>
<p><br><strong>Emrys [They/Him]</strong></p>
<p>I assume UMAD is one of these new systems that had to be implemented, are there any other notable new systems that rival UMADs reach and power?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Emrys [They/Him]</strong> I assume UMAD is one of these new systems that had to be implemented, are there any other notable new systems that rival UMADs reach and power?</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Within Belthas no.&nbsp; UMAD exists as a government institution and a major part of one of the three divisions within government.</p>
<p>With that said UMAD is not the only place that might be considered an Academy.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Is there... perhaps...</p>
<p>Clown Academy?<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Fourth Section - The Genesis of UMAD</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>There were established places of local education in some of the largest cities that took on a secular stance.&nbsp; These places educated the youth en mass for those who could afford it.&nbsp; These paid schools were rare however but under new rule have become a hot topic for the courts.&nbsp; When Dial was established it was part of their city plan to create facilities to educate by application and sometimes lottery.&nbsp; Towering in the center however would be an establishment created for the advancement of military defense and public education not too dissimilar to the old model of Academia.&nbsp; In fact it is from this that it would be given its name in concept.&nbsp; This place would also be used as a public access for unrestricted education of aetherial studies to those who passed proper admissions examinations.&nbsp; The concepts taught within the walls would not have religious restriction and would also not necessarily condemn the study of any one aetherial school.&nbsp; Thus it was Universal in it's teachings of Magic and established itself in a system similar to the Academia and located within the walls of Dial.</p>
<p>I think you see what I did there</p>
<p>From this point I would like to change this from lecture to discourse.&nbsp; I will elaborate from your questions.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Question Break</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>Rephrase, How many other major academies are there apart from UMAD and are they government affiliated as well?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Is there... perhaps... Clown Academy?</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Not that I'm aware of in Belthas but there are traveling troupes that might educate one to a very visual comedic style of entertainment.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Snow_Woman</strong> Rephrase, How many other major academies are there apart from UMAD and are they government affiliated as well?</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Within Belthas or would you consider other nations?</p>
<p><br><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>both I guess</p>
<p>Does your government reaches to other nations academically?</p>
<p><br><strong>@Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>Does your government reaches to other nations academically?</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>It has attracted those of other nationalities, yes.</p>
<p>There are smaller schools within Belthas as mentioned such as Amyntas Wizardry Boarding School but the model we have taken on makes UMAD in a way an experiment of it's own.&nbsp; There are others who take on the model of an Academy elsewhere.</p>
<p>Obelus has a system within it's Pillars.&nbsp; Then there are those schools in Victoria.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>On the subject of education I actually wanted to ask, what's a typical day of teaching for you?</p>
<p>I imagine you've got other duties since you're head of Culture, but how does the average day go?</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>I don't typically lecture actually!&nbsp; there are dedicated lecturers but I have my research and I run a department.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>Can we ask what the next topic might be?</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; Is there any other questions or should we move on to talking about the next topic?</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Considering the limited scope of public education that you're presently trying to amend...</p>
<p>How do you normally handle the application process.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Is it strictly elitist in nature so only those that have been given access to education can try?</p>
<p>Or do you test in different ways to allow for opportunities that the unlettered etc might not otherwise get.</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>The application process is typically handled in 3 steps.&nbsp; We like to say 4 with the first step simply coming in through the front doors!&nbsp; You start with a competency examination followed by a physical aptitude test and conclude with a interview.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>That... didn't really answer.</p>
<p>Do you dictate to people that can't read during the competency exam? Or just kick them out, or let them fail and waste their time?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Is it strictly elitist in nature so only those that have been given access to education can try? Or do you test in different ways to allow for opportunities that the unlettered etc might not otherwise get.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately for those unlettered they do better under the employment side of operations.&nbsp; They can spend time learning through exposure that way!&nbsp; We have a success story here of someone who transferred into the research track, Gillie.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Fair enough, we stan a queen.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><u>Next Topic Discussion + Extra Questions</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Any other questions before we proceed to discussing the next topic?</p>
<p>Very well!</p>
<p>First question for you all, do you have a recommendation for my next lecture?</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Clowns.</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Second, this is your chance to provide input on Aetherial Studies' lecture!</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Oh nice, do you know what the topic is going to be?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Clowns.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>I might need to ask someone else to speak for such a lecture.</p>
<p><br><strong>Vel Blackwood</strong></p>
<p>more on the old kingdom and the lead up to the revolution</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Vel Blackwood</strong> more on the old kingdom and the lead up to the revolution</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Good one!</p>
<p><br><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>A full list of the gods or a world map lesson.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Famous literary texts, either historic or religious in nature, or just plain entertainment if you've got plays and poetry to share.</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Snow_Woman</strong> A full list of the gods or a world map lesson.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>A full list might be a bit much but we could certainly talk about many!&nbsp; Also a list I don't feel makes a lecture.</p>
<p><br><strong>Emrys [They/Him]</strong></p>
<p>World map and geography might be good</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong> Famous literary texts, either historic or religious in nature, or just plain entertainment if you've got plays and poetry to share.</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>All sorts!</p>
<p><br><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>I want to know more on the locations of the cities and nations and such of your world for a physical reference for the connections of everything, you know?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@BrunoGelehrte</strong> A full list might be a bit much but we could certainly talk about many!&nbsp; Also a list I don't feel makes a lecture.</i></p>
<p><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>Well yes a list wouldn't be lol</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>A world map would definitely be helpful, especially with understanding the history and politics of your world</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>"If PM-1 were a D&amp;D setting, what classes would each researcher be." - the lecture</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Chuck [any/all]</strong> A world map would definitely be helpful, especially with understanding the history and politics of your world</i></p>
<p><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Cartographers offer differing results</p>
<p><br><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>Is it because of all the aetherial happenings in your world?</p>
<p><br><i><strong>@Dowan (Mom/Dad) "</strong>If PM-1 were a D&amp;D setting, what classes would each researcher be." - the lecture</i></p>
<p><strong>tired, scheming little shit</strong></p>
<p>i think that is more of a class discussion rather than a lecture</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Like different continent shapes due to perspective? I know some old maps from our plane had some places just stretched out due to the curviture of the earth</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>What I hear is a general lecture on Literature, a general lecture on faith, a general lecture on geography, the revolution and it's causes.</p>
<p>ADJUTANTs would you mind making a poll?</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Will do</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>Next, any input on the aetherial studies topic?</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>Chucks got it</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to consider vote-duping and IP check stuff..</p>
<p>Last time I made a poll for this ARG, some people tried to tilt the vote by cheating.</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Strawpoll is being annoying, this might take a while</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>https://strawpoll.com/dcakzpv96 I set one up already if that helps.</p>
<p>sips coffee</p>
<p>StrawPoll</p>
<p>Next Culture Lecture | StrawPoll.com</p>
<p>What's your opinion? Vote now: Geography, Literature, Religion, Revolution...</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Dowan</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>Smh</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>imma post this in the lecture hall too so people can see it easier</p>
<p><br><strong>Asmodeus Morningstar [They/Xem]</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Dowan, it wasnt working on Chucks side</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>I'm a helper</p>
<p><br><strong>BrunoGelehrte</strong></p>
<p>If there are no suggestions for the aetherial studies lecture then I'll move to Ask Bruno for general questions until the end of the hour.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>My suggestion is Practical Applications of Fireball.</p>
<p><br><strong>Snow_Woman</strong></p>
<p>I don't know enough about Aetherial honestly. I need to go through and re learn</p>
<p><br><strong>Chuck [any/all]</strong></p>
<p>Actually I would like to ask for a lecture that goes in depth on the mechanics of casting</p>
<p>e.g.: draw scales, how that relates to 5-d space, etc</p>
<p><br><strong>Dowan (Mom/Dad)</strong></p>
<p>A show and tell of cool aeonized objects would be fun too. Tell us what different people in the department use.<br>&nbsp;</p>
