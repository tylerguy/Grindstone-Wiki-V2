<h6>Central Territories</h6>
<p>West of Central Belthas is Oudste. This place occupies the majority of the major mountain ranges but also plenty of neighboring land. While not the best description we approximate the mountains in this region to making something of a y shape. The country of Oudste has many contested areas but has commonly accepted boarders between it and neighboring countries. Oudste is also a country with many settlements found in the sub-terra as well as above ground with "tolerated" settlements that are not officially recognized Oudstian and are governed with unique laws to the settlement. The town government of settlements in Oudste are some of the most varied. Due to its unique position the government regulates trade with fierce tariffs which many trade caravans accept for scheduled protected travel periods through the sub-terra of the mountains instead of trading through the loop, the bitter North, or deal with radicals and the blightlands to the South.</p>
<p>Oudste has two capital cities of the same name but most of their governing entities reside in the East and not the West Donderspleet. The aforementioned y shape has a longer North West arm and a hooked tail. While Oudste claims much of the land in between the North West arm's tip to the tail of the mountains due West of Oudste are nine separate nations. This will be a little more difficult to explain the positions of these nations so please do not hesitate to ask questions.</p>
<p>To the far South West of Oudste is a country that is bordered by the Mountains owned by Oudste to its East, the Blightlands to its South with a great lake on the boarder between the two, and three other countries one to its South West, one to its North West, and one directly due North. This country, with the exception of the far South, is near in what you call latitude with Belthas' Grain Belt. This Country is known as Topos Khazhak and it's capital is located near center of the country on a major river. The Capital is referred to Her Tjaldvagnar.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that countries gain their names through the impression and phonic ears of those who experience those countries. It is for that reason that many countries has multiple names depending on who you are speaking to. An example in your world might be Nippon/Japan. The Country that boarders Topos Khazhak to the South West is known most commonly as Spitoutheo or Tomerkansp by most Belthian citizens. Much like Topos Khazhak it remains primarily on the latitude of the grain belt in Belthas but also some of the tropics to the South. To its North is the same country to the North East of Topos Khazahk, the direct South is the Blightlands, The Southwest yet another of the central territories, and to the North West it boarders the other super nation Victoria. The capital of this country is Hreinleiki which is one of two major Metropolis in the country.</p>
<p>The nation to the South West is known as Autarky which is a mostly tropical nation that connects with the Ocean to the South. To its West is Victoria and to the East the Blightlands. The capital of Autarky is Aglaia which is a mostly landlocked place near a major river crossing North East and South West. There are Two other Major Metropolis in the country that at centers of trade besides Aglaia.</p>
<p>North East of Spituotheo but North West of Topos Khazhak is a nation completely within the latitude of what we call the grain belt with three additional countries bordering it including Victoria to the West, another country due North, and another to the East. This is Hlyri Lond with its capital Tyrant.</p>
<p>To its North East but due North of Topos Khazhak is a small lake rich nation which half remains in the latitude of the grainbelt while the Northern half within the latitude of the wetlands. To the East it boarders Oudste also while being bordered by two other nations to the North and Northwest. The Eastern boarder touching Oudste is not only mountains however but continues past the "y" hook touching the non-mountainous area of Western Oudste. This Country is known as Pasimaetir and has the capital Skjol Vatiniv.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the West of Pasimaetir and North of Hlyri Lond is a country that just barely touches the boarder to the South West of Victoria but also is bordered to the North, North West, and North East by the remaining Central Territories. To its farthest South it just barely is within the latitude of the grain belt but extends North all through the wetlands latitude and even outside of that belt in the furthest Northern area of the nation. This nation is known as Mezzomond with its capital Veru. All of its west boarder within the wetlands latitude and a small part just outside is the boarder of our next nation of conversation.</p>
<p>The West most of the central territories has the largest lake within the central territories. This Country is West of Mezzomond, East of Victoria, and South of yet another of the central territories. By longitude it is mostly within the wetlands with just the Northern tip outside of it. This country is known as Zontanera with its capital Nog Aud.</p>
<p>The Nation to the North of Zontera is Nombrepuer which is also North of Mezzomond, East of Victoria, and West of the last of the central territories. It is located entirely outside of the wetlands but not yet so north as to begin matching climate with "The North". The capital is Brennimark.</p>
<p>Finally a nation bordered by Oudste to the East, Victoria to the North West, Nombrepuer due West, Mezzomond to the South West, and Pasimaetir due South. This place also reaches the furthest North of any of the Central Territories connecting with the wetlands latitude in its furthest South region. Evigstande with the capital Gjof af Eldi.</p>
<p>Now that you are familiar with all the Central Territories I will break to allow for questions. Tomorrow I will discuss the Blightlands and Victoria in detail before opening up about specific geography, landmarks, and unique places.</p>

<h4>Question Break</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>I'm accepting questions. A reminder that we are reviewing some general geography right now and will after this discuss specific landmarks and notable areas of Homeland.</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>Does your planet have a name?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>For the time being please refer to us by planar designation.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan Clownin</strong></p>
  <p>Does UMAD have offices in all of these other nations, as a Belthean institution? If not, what are their versions of UMAD called and like?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>We do have foreign Embassies in most but not all nations. The Belthean Embassy is operated by UMAD officials.</p>
  <p><strong>Emerald</strong></p>
  <p>How many continents have been discussed so far?</p>
  <p><strong>Blaise</strong></p>
  <p>We have discussed two thus far but only gone in detail on one. The one relevant for the interdepartmental assignment and challange.</p>
  <p>Once we get into unique geography we can discuss things like a salt water lake that is a major lake in Belthas and other such features.</p>
