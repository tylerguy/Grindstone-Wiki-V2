<p>Good evening</p>
<h3>Entertainment Media</h3>
<p>Entertainment mediums within the world of PM-1 are quite simplistic in terms of designs, when compared to the personal familiarity of EXT-918 in this day and age. There are several that can be considered ubiquitous across nations and cultures, and many others that are quite interesting and unique to local customs and culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most obvious forms of entertainment that exist with widespread popularity are things that are available to all, and develop regardless of the resources and influence in an area. Things like singing and music have existed since ancient times, as an expression not only of praise and worship to the gods, but as a means of personal enjoyment or entertainment to others. As mentioned in passing previously, the god Basileus is known as the god of music and the holder of that domain, due to the degree to which they embodied music and grew and evolved it as a concept, to such measures that they are now synonymous with it in Perfection and Beauty. It is for this reason that they are known as the god “to whom all songs are sung.”</p>
<p>Though Basileus does hold the domain, the reasons one has for participating in song or performing music are widespread. For some it is a means of expression their admiration and dedication to their principal deity, leading to hymns and songs sung within the faith. To others, it is a means of expression, and a form of art that can exist no matter where you come from. The styles of music that have developed across PM-1’s homeland are varied and unique. Some perform with ululations and employ simple instruments of wood and stone that have been simply worked and fashioned, such as the liath of the north, whose culture is based on scarcity of resources and the dangers of their homelands. Within the same part of the world however are the people of Gijuntou, which are predominately rau, who developed the cello based off of the simpler orc viol. Further south within Victoria brass instruments can be found, and to their east within the Central Territories, a number of instruments exist that can be used without the use of lips due to the considerable population of val within that region of the world.</p>
<p>With the invention of music and song came the eventual evolution of opera and plays, as people began to incorporate their oral histories or complex stories into the mediums. Such performances were often conducted in the throne rooms and dining halls of powerful lords and ladies, or in central market squares as a means of raising public morale. It did not take long however for specialized structures to be necessary to house such events, to prevent disrupting politics and commerce, and to allow for the growth of the medium with things like set design. This proved exceptionally successful in parts of the world where opera houses and auditoriums could be constructed.</p>
<p>Because these were not accessible to the common man and were reserved for social elites, smaller and simpler performances became commonplace in pubs and taverns as well. With smaller stages and only a few instrumental performers, many of the shows began to lean into their handicapped accommodations rather than trying to stand out against them. Forms of “slapstick” comedy became the norm in such places, and with easily understood and digested story materials, so that there would be no need for complicated sets and costumes and live bands… and so that the common people could comprehend the subject matter and keep them appeased with a form of entertainment accessible to them that in part mirrored that of the social elite.</p>
<p>There are a variety of other forms of entertainment that exist as well. And rather than merely prattle on about them one at a time, it might be best to let you pick what you are most interested in...</p>
<p>So, please react accordingly.</p>

<h3>Illegal Forms of Entertainment</h3>
<p>That's time.</p>
<p>As discussed, forms of entertainment have been simplified for the consumption and enjoyment of the common man. This has not been limited solely to opera and plays, however. There are a number of forms of recreation that have been deemed illegal to partake in; some with good reasons, while others are a means of establishing control or forcing scarcity to maintain artificial value.</p>
<p>A good example of a form of entertainment that is illegal for good reason is the participation of honor duels, or underground arena prize fights. Bloodsport is quite popular as a form of entertainment, but the large and government-controlled arenas of many nations require fees for your viewing of each individual fight, and though they put on grand performances, not many can afford to see them often. It is much cheaper to go to an underground arena and pay for a full night of viewing fights, and then have a chance to win some money back by betting on the competition.</p>
<p>Because these fights are undocumented and have very few guidelines or restrictions, not to mention the government loses money, they are deemed immoral and illegal and a hazard to the community and public good. This is true in almost all nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the Au’pakian faith, there is a form of honor dueling in which you challenge an opponent to a fight. Typically, this is understood to be to the death. It can take place anywhere the challenge is called, and should the person challenged agree to the fight, it takes place immediately. This has proven disastrous to bystanders and caused a great amount of public turmoil, and so such honor duels were also deemed illegal. By extension, duels under the name of Arevik are considered illegal in Belthas and some of the Central Territories, while other Central Territories and Victoria consider the duels under Arevik’s name to be constrained enough not to warrant a danger or nuisance.</p>
<p>The use of recreational drugs is not in and of itself illegal in most places, until the quality of such drugs exceeds a certain limit. As an example, alchemical essence of power, also known as alchemist dust, has certain enjoyable effects upon the mind and body of those who partake in it. In its lower qualities it is a green tinted crystalline structure, but once it reaches a quality of four or greater, it changes in hue to a bluer tone. At this level of quality, the effects it has on people are more pronounced and become increasingly addictive and dangerous. The product can also be used in a number of alchemical goods to heighten their potency, and so if left unchecked at such levels, could cause dangerous alchemical imbalances. At best, this could ruin something it is put into. At worst, it could cause a volatile reaction and blow the entire lab up.</p>
<p>Because of these considerable dangers, the use of certain alchemical goods is restricted and intended for proper use under qualified professionals only. Certain plants such as the Lips of Qoseem and the Eyes of Qoseem may find their use in religious services, like funerals within Belthas. But their growth and distribution is carefully maintained, due to the incredible danger they pose.</p>
<p>Alright. For the last topic of this lecture, we will be discussing specific and specialized forms of entertainment that have developed across PM-1, thanks to the unique history, customs and culture of certain areas.</p>
<p>Who's ready to talk weird shit?</p>
<h3>Weird Shit</h3>
<p>Many decades ago, in the cold and frozen north, a battle took place on a massive scale between the peoples of the Green Orc Territories and the Red Orc Territories. It took place in a settlement that was little more than a stopping camp for traders on their way to Trono, the capital of the Green Orc Territory. The area was heavily forested and some rivers did wind through the area, but there was still enough of a clearing between the forestry to allow for considerable movement of mounted cavalry on the part of the red orc peoples, who had quickly blazed their way across the land and sewn chaos.</p>
<p>Going to face this approaching challenge, the green orc peoples met and prepared at this simple encampment for the arriving horde of enemy mounted units. They were outnumbered heavily, and all on foot, and so the odds seemed entirely stacked against them. Nevertheless, they held their ground and waited for the enemy to approach.</p>
<p>Many points in history have moments like this, where a brilliant strategy is employed by a cunning or even reckless tactician to turn the tides of the battle.</p>
<p>This was not one of those moments.</p>
<p>When the red orc forces arrived, the single strategy that had been developed by the defending forces was “hit them hard, hit them straight on…” And as the cavalry charged down upon them, they charged right back. It was a brutal, stupid, sluggish melee of brawn versus brawn with no real thought put into anything. The defenders were all just there to meet the challenge and get into a fight; they hadn’t come as some trained army equipped for battle. So they hit, they fought, and they tossed their enemy about. Literally, tossed them.</p>
<p>Among the simple green orc forces were a number of very strong full orcs, who had the sheer brawn to grab at the reins of the charging enemy horses and throw them down to the ground. Or, to pull them to a sudden stop, and then lift and hurl them and their riders overhead. At least, that’s how the stories go.</p>
<p>The green orcs wound up losing the fight, but did such a number on the morale of the red orcs, and crippled their cavalry, that when they got closer to Trono they were utterly crushed by the defending army there.</p>
<p>Since then, forces from both sides have met up in the same area on the anniversary of the battle to contend all over again. It has become a source of… cultural pride? In place of actual horses, they now have large wood and stone effigies that they lift and hurl, competing to see who can throw the furthest on each side. Sometimes the contest gets violent, but for the most part it is a simple contest of pride between the two nations… and possibly a form of diplomacy, to show off to one another how strong their forces are, to prevent mutual invasions.</p>
<p>The settlement grew due to the popularity of the contest, and became named Voo do cavalo. “Flight of the horse.”</p>
<h3>More Weird Shit</h3>
<p>A similarly strange contest exists within Oudste, in the town of We Verloren het Kasteel, which has a unique history. It was not always named such, but was renamed after the theft of an entire castle by angry mountainfolk. They took advantage of the holy day of Frik, to sieve the entire structure in a single night and break it down, relocating it further up the mountainside. Unfortunately for them, and the town below, they were not skilled architects and the ground on which they relocated the castle was not very stable.</p>
<p>Their prank cost them both their own lives, and the lives of most the town below during an awful rock slide. When they mayor of the town was required to go before his king and explain, he himself was so confused and at a loss for words that all he could manage to say were “We lost the castle.”</p>
<p>The king found this too hilarious to execute him, and allowed him to return to rebuild the town, under strict new oversight and guidelines… and with the town’s name changed to We Verloren het Kasteel. Literally, “We lost the castle.”</p>
<p>What started as a piece of tragic history has since become a game for children to play, where you build a small cairn of stones on the mountainside and must protect it from the enemy team, who must steal the stones and move the up and rebuild the cairn in order to “win” the game. It is a game known as Castle Keeping, since the goal is to keep the other team from stealing your castle of rocks.</p>
