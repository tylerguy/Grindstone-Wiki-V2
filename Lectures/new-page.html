<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p>So, Necromancy is a large complicated study like any other so I'm going to run down a few reminders and I'm going to encourage interactivity in my lectures unlike some lecturers. First of all everyone you need remember that Necromancy here at UMAD is actually a study of programming where it pertains to frames and objects within frame. Those who wish to understand programming on living systems or the theory of the casting specifically necessary for programming that is intersectional with aetherial studies. Also as a reminder I'm an expert on aetherial mechanisms and communications but anyone in necromancy has likely experimented with undead as they are usually much easier to program than full frames or some aetherial mechanisms. I find my lectures typically drift depending on the audience to be either more technical or theoretical but tonight we will be discussing some basics in understanding programming and maintenance. Since I've been on EXT-918 I have a few comparisons I can draw to better paint a picture for you I hope. To jump into things lets talk a little about degradation following that we can explain the relationship of contingency casting with complex programs and when a complex program is called a construct.</p>
<h6>Degradation</h6>
<p>After one has accomplished creating a system of programming, a construct, it should be noted that this system is not perfect. For several reasons constructs will degrade over time and require maintenance. Sorry for anyone who wants to save up a small fortune to buy a large metal assistant but you'll need to keep shelling out more money to get that assistant to continue to function or else learn how to program on your own. Degradation occurs for several reasons but there are measures that can slow down the progression of degradation in a construct. For instance, if the construct has fine tuned points of aeonization you can limit interference thus minimizing damage to the frame itself. Lets break down what these phrases mean however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know the frames are almost like skeletons of aether not normally visible to the unaided eye and require contingent casting by the programming in order to continue to draw aether to maintain their presence. It is for this reason we call all frames dynamic. The aether present in the frames in a moment is not the same aether present in a frame in the next moment. Since constructs are constantly "casting" on themselves they are very visible with simple aeonization, some of the largest and most dense constructs can be visible from far distances if an aeonization expert is present in fact.</p>
<p>On the Elementary Components of Theoretical Self Aetherial Programmed Spellcasting is a a text on how it is possible that aetherial mechanisms can themselves utilize the aether if programmed to - but this is impractical due to the maintenance required in programming. There has never been a perfectly non-degrading construct. Sometimes when the construct aeonizes and summates aether it creates something called interference. Interference is one of several things that cause degradation. Interference occurs when the aether summated crosses the frame at a point disrupting its structure. With enough interference minor lines of programming might dissipate with unintended directions or complete interruption much like how mutations occur in genetics. Interference occurs because it is impossible to adjust a contruct to predict aetherial wave patterns with perfect accuracy thoughout tim(sic).</p>
<p>First questions before I move to more on degradation.</p>
<h6>Question Break</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>What do visible constructs look like? What color are they, and what shape</p>
  <p>I'm imagining like a lot of perpendicular glowing lines</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>So is the variable amounts of aeonization going through a construct able to be programmed to be more efficient with its usage, instead of being subject to intense changes from moment to moment?</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse</strong></p>
  <p>Are you talking about degredation of parts or degredation of programming?</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @emerald (</strong>What do visible constructs look like? What color are they, and what shape)</p>
  <p>Do you mean by use of an aeonization expert or what a construct generally looks like?</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @DovaDonut </strong>(So is the variable amounts of aeonization going through a construct able to be programmed to be more efficient with its usage, instead…)</p>
  <p>With the most important tool for proper aeonization yes, math.</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @Mouse</strong> (Are you talking about degredation of parts or degredation of programming?)</p>
  <p>Programming.</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse</strong></p>
  <p>In this case, is the construct a program or the program a construct?</p>
  <p>Because you talk about constructs self-casting</p>
  <p>but constructs in terms of ideas are intangible objects that theoretically serve a purpose</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Is it only pragmatically impossible to predict Aetherial wave patterns throughout all time, or is it impossible even in an ideal theoretic scenario?</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong></p>
  <p>Constructs are programmed frames. I highly encourage reading a lecture by my colleague Pauchik on them. To simplify, imagine robotics conducted with invisible skeletons that are in part hardware but completely software. The remaining hardware being the material or the stuff that is made motile or can be moved where the programming is linked to.</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse</strong></p>
  <p>Okay. I was confused by the how the word was used.</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>So is interference more of a physical, observable trait, or is it a hidden occurence, like cell mitosis (where the change in living code would be altered)? And if hidden, would this be cause for routine check ins with the program, or is the program untouchable once active?</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @Name</strong> (Is it only pragmatically impossible to predict Aetherial wave patterns throughout all time, or is it impossible even in an ideal theoretic scenario?)</p>
  <p>I would say that is an impossibility as the wave patterns change due to several factors including the presence of aetherial casting in a plane.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Aye, fair. Hard to get a computer to simulate itself otherwise you’ve some funky infinite recursion, I guess.</p>
  <p>But could it be possible to send a message from the point of aeonization to the rest of the frame communicating information on wave phenomena in the aetherial matrix so that other points of aeonization summate less or more, to adjust for the coming wave? This does require the communication to be faster than the waves though I feel.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong></p>
  <p>Clever and you do see the issue already. Interestingly enough you are talking about something that became necessary for utilizing some war-time constructs. The term for the seemingly separate construct within the system to interpret changes is called a Dolmetscher.</p>
  <p>Still has it's imperfections.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>Something like this, if it makes it less vague.</p>
  <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:400px;"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892114420589817877/930635299787272252/IMG_1218.png?width=400&amp;height=300" alt="Image"></figure>
  <p>Ah.</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>We will have an advanced topic on Dolmetscher in the future but your theories aren't far off topic from that lecture.</p>
  <p>Also the Dolmetscher is important for the idea of the Heuristic Construct. A much later topic.</p>
  <p><strong>Name</strong></p>
  <p>I look forward to it.</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
  <p>Any other questions so far?</p>
  <p>This is where I inform you all that I will also be lecturing some tomorrow as well as the next day. This lecture may need to be broken up into two parts.</p>
  <p><strong>Dowan White</strong></p>
  <p>Any historically significant constructs? Or really, really poorly devised ones?</p>
  <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:1.375em;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/662052622575861760.webp?size=44&amp;quality=lossless" alt=":491842403792322580:"></figure>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>So many...</p>
  <p><strong>Pyra</strong></p>
  <p>(understandable)</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Once, during the rule of Othello The First he commissioned a bridge that would raise and lower by a command. The issue was it was impractical to create such a large construct and some of the programming existed outside the bridge itself so the first person to cross the bridge with lead erased a large portion of the programming itself. A colossal waste of time and money.</p>
  <p><strong>Researcher White</strong></p>
  <p>Good god. PM-1 has the Boring Co.</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler</strong></p>
  <p>Any other questions?</p>
  <p><strong>Emrys</strong></p>
  <p>is degradation similar to how batteries passively lose charge or does it only occur when the construct is actively doing something?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>Yes! I’m on break so I only have one that I can ask, so you mentioned that the Fran is “not usually visible to the unaided eye” does that mean there are people out there who can see Aether? And what kinds of aids are there to help visualize the frame? Or is this usually unnecessary and only done for practical purposes?</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @Emrys</strong> (is degradation similar to how batteries passively lose charge or does it only occur when the construct is actively doing something?)</p>
  <p>As casting is needed. So both is the easiest answer.</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @TheAutumnWriter (</strong>Yes! I’m on break so I only have one that I can ask, so you mentioned that the Fran is “not usually visible to the unaided eye” does that…)</p>
  <p>The aeonization school. You'll learn about aetherial signatures, marks, residue in aetherial studies.</p>
  <p>Last call. Tomorrow I'll elaborate more on degradation and other causes of it.</p>
  <p>This concludes tonight's lecture then.</p>
