<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the Project Grindstone Wiki!</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Project Grindstone</strong> is an <i>Alternate Reality Game</i> (ARG) where you are working to become accepted into a magical university on another plane of existence. The <i>Universal Magic Academy at Dial</i>, or UMAD for short, has made contact with our plane and begun the process of bringing in applicants to work for their organization. As you get acclimated to life at UMAD, youâ€™ll learn more about the organization, the people that work for them and their world.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The amount of lore and information might be intimidating at first, but a majority of it are things you'll learn as you spend time interacting with the community. The Wiki serves as an ever-evolving database, but the best way to learn is experiencing! Don't hesitate to ask questions about anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We're glad you're here and hope you enjoy your time with us at UMAD!</p>
