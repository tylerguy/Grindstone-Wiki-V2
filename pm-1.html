  <li>When discussing Geography, “Homeland” refers to UMAD's location and the land mass it resides on.<ul>
      <li>It is not the only known land mass (continent)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The world hasn't been discovered in its entirety and much of the information such as maps, is Need to Know/Classified<ul>
      <li>Travelling far from the west coast is impossible due to a large, violent and eternal storm</li>
      <li>&nbsp;Only recently made contact across waters to the east, similar to ocean between the Americas and Europe</li>

  <li>Countries gain their names through impression and phonic ears of those who experience them.</li>
</ul>
