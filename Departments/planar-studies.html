<blockquote>
  <p>Planar Studies, typically referred to as Planar, examines extraplanar interplay. This department observes the Belthidian Laws and how their interactions with material differ within five-dimensional loci and the interaction between other planes in relative space. This is typically conducted through the mass summation of aether to produce planar overlay and observing the change in natural phenomena. This description requires adequate warning as determined by The Cultural Research Department as the study of extra-planar space comes with several risks. While the laws on some planes may change the interactions with material causing one to quickly re-evaluate the definition of “air” others could cause the loss of the concept of time or alter personal perception to be incompatible with their native plane. Many Planar Studies Researchers act as field researchers and conduct inter-departmental studies to further our understanding of the universe beyond their own plane. The examination of how space in the universe effects the reality we live in has nearly limitless applications. - Blaise</p>

<p><strong>Goal of Planar Studies</strong></p>
<p>- understand how Belthidian laws and their interactions with the material within the 5th dimensional Aetheral matrix &nbsp;</p>
<p>- allows estimation about further planes and how those planes interact with current residence and other planes</p>
