<blockquote>
  <p>“Planar Studies, typically referred to as Planar, examines extraplanar interplay. This department observes the Belthidian Laws and how their interactions with material differ within five-dimensional loci and the interaction between other planes in relative space. This is typically conducted through the mass summation of aether to produce planar overlay and observing the change in natural phenomena. This description requires adequate warning as determined by The Cultural Research Department as the study of extra-planar space comes with several risks. While the laws on some planes may change the interactions with material causing one to quickly re-evaluate the definition of “air” others could cause the loss of the concept of time or alter personal perception to be incompatible with their native plane. Many Planar Studies Researchers act as field researchers and conduct inter-departmental studies to further our understanding of the universe beyond their own plane. The examination of how space in the universe effects the reality we live in has nearly limitless applications.” - Blaise</p>

<h3><strong>Goal of Planar Studies</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand how Belthidian laws and their interactions with the material within the 5-dimensional Aetherial matrix.</li>
  <li>Allow estimation about further planes and how those planes interact with current residents and other planes.</li>
  <li>Understand the threat of plane touch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Universal Phenomena</h3>
<p><strong><u>Time Dilation</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The rate of passage is determined by proximity to the center however meaning the perception of time slows as you get closer to the center. 100 years might pass in one place in reality before 1 year elsewhere.” - Blaise</p>
  <p>“1:1 ratio between planes on the same ring, as far as I know. But if you go up a ring to the second, there's suddenly a huge tilt in time. Like, an hour of time passing on the first ring becomes a much longer amount of time passing on the second ring.” - Researcher White</p>
  <p>“We have measured and learned the rate of dilation increases in a non linear fashion. &nbsp;This suggests that the 8th ring, the center, is a point where time advances infinitely in an infinitesimal moment. &nbsp;An eternity there would be a moment of fraction there of anywhere else. &nbsp;This suggests the central point is out of time.” - Researcher Zuchterin</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The evidence for measuring dilations are actually quite simpler and require reflecting aetherial waves off of what are simply referred to as "anomalies" which is a cheap term for things we have discovered that are likely not planes within the aetherial matrix. &nbsp;Unfortunately these are not things I can elaborate on here." - Blaise</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>“But do you ultimately bounce aether waves off different anomalies, say one in ring 1, and one in a different ring, then measure difference of return time?” - ThisIsAName0</p>
  <p>“As I understand it, yes.” - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Importance of Higher Dimensions</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The universe exists in 5 dimensional space and so requires two models to visualize it. &nbsp;The biconical model and the fluid disk model. The fluid disk is a fluid mosaic of amorphous ever changing shapes that have a general region defined proximally to the center of all things or from the point of the reality that people are familiar with. &nbsp;Think of it like a flat disk like surface with small areas that are constantly in flux as to where their walls are. The space between them is not empty, it’s called aether which moves fluidly and can be disrupted. The space the aether doesn’t occupy is filled by the limits of these planes of existence. When a clear opening exists between two realities they can overlap at points.</p>
  <p>This is called a planar overlay and strange things can happen at these points. The wave patterns of the aether can be disrupted through a process called summation which is the second step involved in aetherial magic casting of three. Summation is essentially the summation of wave patterns through small manipulations that accumulate. &nbsp;In addition to this design is the idea of rings. &nbsp;Rings are concentric circles radiating out from the center of reality however by tradition the first ring is defined as where the plane that the living are familiar with is located, the center of all things is the eighth ring, and the side of the rings opposite the living reality continues to ascend. So while planes may be the same distance from the center as the living reality (this term has been retired) one is the 15th ring and the other is the 1st ring. &nbsp;Space may be interacted with in a 5 dimensional manner however meaning there are addition dimensions within these “flat surfaces” expressed in the fluid disk model. The biconical model was therefore developed to express this and time dilations in space. &nbsp;In the biconical model the universe looks like an hourglass where the central point is the center of reality much like the center of the disk was too but it also shifts with overlays to explain the passage of time. Time moves in one direction, there is no going back in time even for gods. &nbsp;The rate of passage is determined by proximity to the center however meaning the perception of time slows as you get closer to the center. 100 years might pass in one place in reality before 1 year elsewhere.</p>
  <p>These models are still used today but ideas within these notes are contested." - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Biconical Model</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The hourglass is a model that better defines time dilation. &nbsp;I imagine it had an hourglass on its side. The dimensions I'm talking about are spatial and do not refer to time so the two models together give a better perspective of the universe as a whole.” - Researcher Zuchterin</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Disk Model</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The disk may permit a better understanding of dimension 4 and 5 in space but the hourglass provides a visual to time and a different perspective to the 4 and 5 dimensional space since 5 dimensional space is not an easy visual to beginners in the study” - Researcher Zuchterin</p>

<h3>Plane Touch</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A seemingly random and dangerous effect of planar travel.<ul>
      <li>Best described as a disconnect from the nervous system.<ul>
          <li>“Forgets” how to breathe.</li>
          <li>Paralysis.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can occur with any degree of planar travel, even a little.<ul>
          <li>There is a researcher in Planar Studies that deals with minimal percent of planar character (refer to <a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Lectures/Overlays-Bourdicot">this</a> lecture) required to cause plane touch<a href="https://discord.com/channels/860257333246165034/892114420589817877/922714431039893544"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classes of Plane Touch:<ul>
      <li>Class 1: The condition is present but very difficult to determine.</li>
      <li>Class 2: Outwardly apparent and no need for alchemical treatment, but the afflicted may continue their life uninhibited.</li>
      <li>Class 3: Alchemical treatment is required for the afflicted to function as though they were not afflicted.</li>
      <li>Class 4: Dependency on others heavily required if they go without alchemical treatment, life still heavily affected even with treatment. Can suddenly or slowly degrade into Class 5 and is considered terminal.</li>
      <li>Class 5: Lethal without treatment, dependency needed even with treatment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Planar Overlay and Travel</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That's understandable, so you can use the atherial matrix to target which plane you want for research on the Belthidain laws? Without the use of an overlay?” - TheAutumnWriter [They/Them]</p>
  <p>“Correct. By massive summation we can pull the aether away from space between two planes forcing this overlay. There are limitations and dangers however.” - Researcher Zuchterin</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Typically accomplished by mass summation to force an overlay.<ul>
      <li>Vacate the aether within the 5D region between planes, have them overlap.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Planar overlay is accomplished when two planes occupy the same 5D space. When one plane has their characteristics make up 100% of the overlapping space (refer to <a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Lectures/Overlays-Bourdicot">this</a> lecture), it's said one within that overlapping space has travelled to that plane, if they originated from the other plane in the overlap.<ul>
      <li>Now planes are defined as vacated regions of Aether, so if two planes overlay, how is it that overlay happens in a select space instead of the entire plane? How do the characteristics not “fill” the other plane?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If an overlay occurs why does the overlay not occur entirely over both planes is what you are asking. &nbsp;Why do they only overlay in select places. &nbsp;In part this is due to aeonized zone due to natural or synthetic aetherial exhaust and an observed tension around the structure of planes. &nbsp;While we couldn't measure a pressure evidence suggests that small points of overlay pushing on another plane cannot for the plane to "bend" enough. &nbsp;A theory suggests the Planar Skeleton though there is not enough research to back such a thing though we note tension and some elasticity to their development as though planes with smaller overlays naturally want to reject the overlay thus limiting the time of the overlay. &nbsp;There is a major exception but we can talk about that at a later time." - Researcher Urbarra</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Terminology of the quote:<ul>
      <li>Aeonized zone: The region where you aeonize, or open a hole to the Aetherial matrix.</li>
      <li>Natural aetherial exhaust: Aetherial exhaust with<i>out</i> the interference of a caster.</li>
      <li>Synthetic aetherial exhaust: Aetherial exhaust with the interference of a caster.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This tension on the boundary of planes seems to hold “the relative space that acts in accordance with the Belthidian laws to create the natural laws for the relative space,” from Researcher Urbarra verbatim.</li>
  <li>Natural laws may vary from plane to plane, e.g. the changing of the meaning of “air” and the concept of time.<ul>
      <li>This makes planar travel quite dangerous, as outlined in <a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Lectures/Plane-Touch">this</a> lecture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
