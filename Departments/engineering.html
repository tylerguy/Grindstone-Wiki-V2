<blockquote>
  <p>"The Engineering Department is the most frequently utilized for military research and development but it also is responsible for several civil projects especially during reconstruction. The engineering department studies the Belthidian Laws, their effects on material , and the utilization of these ideas to design and improve machines of function or processes. Please note this department presently lacks a Department Head." - Blaise</p>
