<blockquote>
  <p>The Necromancy Department contrary to the understanding most have is not limited to the animation of dead tissue. While service undead are produced by employees here the research team is dedicated to the advanced study of Aetherial programming. They understand in collaboration with other departments how to create immaterial and Aetherial systems that interact with material. Constructs of glass, metal, wood, or any real material are programmed by designing complicated multidimensional programs to cover an area called an Aetherial frame. Aside from constructs and animation the necromancy department is responsible for stationary constructs often referred to as enchanted objects. The Necromancy department assists in security, locating and correcting issues within programming, and the theory of programming the aforementioned constructs. - Blaise</p>

  <p>“Undead are typically what people think of when they think of Necromancers and with good reason!&nbsp; Our title comes from the idea we animate dead and we certainly do!&nbsp; I don't know a single programming specialist who hasn't animated before” - Pauchik</p>

<ul>
  <li>Necromancers “enchant", though they are not enchanters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://grindstonewiki.com/en/Info/Schools-Of-Magic#programming">School of Magic</a> used frequently by Necromancy<ul>
      <li>Not to be confused with the stage of casting (Aetherial)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can be very complicated, though shortcuts can be made</li>
</ul>
<h2>Constructs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Made by the interaction of Aetherial Frames with the material in plane</li>
  <li>Classifications<ul>
      <li>Large Frame</li>
      <li>Small Frame<ul>
          <li>Small does not mean simple, rather means it occupies a small amount of space</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Animation of the dead is only one way to create a construct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aetherial Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Come in various shapes and sizes</li>
  <li>Purpose of Aetherial Mechanisms<ul>
      <li>to be able to repeat the same thing over and over again</li>
      <li>be used for a complex function that does not require movement from a general place in space</li>
      <li>the casting of a spell on command</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Like Communication Tools</li>
  <li>When someone thinks of enchanting an object, this is what they’re thinking of.</li>
  <li>Pauchik invented programming that is more efficient to recreate<ul>
      <li>Device known as a tricky quill - an object that records as you speak</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mechanisms that cast on command break down<ul>
      <li>the more difficult the casting, the more likely they are to do so since people are always casting and the wave patterns of Aether is always changing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Undead</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Much easier to create than other constructs, working with what is already there<ul>
      <li>Often happens during training</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Undead break down physically pretty fast<ul>
      <li>Specialists that fix up the dead aka slow decay</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alchemists and Necromancers frequently work together when they specialize on this “cheap and efficient” way to create constructs.</li>
  <li>Undead do not make good constructs for a common person<ul>
      <li>They require a lot of maintenance and more programming will need to be added to keep them functioning</li>
      <li>Eventually they will becoming indistinguishable from Full Frame Constructs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Wake Necromancers<ul>
      <li>People who animate loved ones for a proper goodbye</li>
      <li>Not believed that this is actually the person saying goodbye, so mostly for the mourners.</li>
      <li>Often will need to make programming to assist with making the construct close to how the deceased was remembered by relaying information provided to them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Frame</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most complicated construct of all</li>
  <li>Requires very large and elaborate frames, but are good for the manipulation of any material in space and can have a large list of commands.</li>
  <li>For Defense<ul>
      <li>Constructs of metal can be programmed to be trained in combat and other things<ul>
          <li>These constructs are very expensive and time consuming to create</li>
          <li>A separate craftsman is responsible for creating the body, treating each one as a work of art.</li>
          <li>Very rare that these are commissioned except by the government or large organizations</li>
          <li>Dial has a few such constructs that assist with defense, Pauchik helping with the programming.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Contingent Single Casters</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Also known as Scrolls</li>
  <li>Items are made for efficient use<ul>
      <li>For casters who are not yet experts or even novices, but need to utilize a spell outside of their ability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Small Frame construct, occupying little space though they can be complicated</li>
  <li>Scrolls cast a spell with little effort, instructions to act through the whole process but only once.</li>
  <li>Scrolls require maintenance in the event they have aged too long or are too complicated</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frames</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Directionality, Rate and Intensity are the three characteristics of frames.<ul>
      <li>They are all important for Frames, but makes programming possibilities almost endless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Directionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complicated, not well understand but well enough to create programs</li>
  <li>Linked to the “Up-Theory”</li>
  <li>Generally important to determine spatial direction of the terminus for each segment to function properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rate</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The amount of pulses over a certain time over properly activated</li>
  <li>Resting Rate<ul>
      <li>Pulse at anytime when a particular stimuli is not in effect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Active Rate<ul>
      <li>Pulse at anytime when a particular stimuli IS in effect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For instance: a construct responds to a command word, when the word is spoken, the active rate is determined. Otherwise, simply resting rate.</li>
  <li>Constructs require and constant and steady stream of aether, to keep a frame intact there must be a constant rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intensity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The amount of aether within each pulse</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>there is a command pulse for the interaction of the segments of a frame (unlike a river, faucet or any other analogy using water to compare the flow of aether)</li>
  <li>Segments are portions of a line that have a terminus, sometimes two, which the aetherial pulse travels through and obeys certain simple actions.<ul>
      <li>Terminus - a final point in space or time; an end or extremity.</li>
      <li>Some lines within the frame could have dozens, hundreds, or in extreme cases thousands of segments to properly program.</li>
      <li>A Large number of segments<ul>
          <li>Many of the segments might have several directions of facing terminus’</li>
          <li>Creates a visual that upon close inspection, lines begin to look like a bunch of little lines cluttered and intersecting</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
