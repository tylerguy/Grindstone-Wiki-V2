<blockquote>
  <p>The Necromancy Department contrary to the understanding most have is not limited to the animation of dead tissue. While service undead are produced by employees here the research team is dedicated to the advanced study of Aetherial programming. They understand in collaboration with other departments how to create immaterial and Aetherial systems that interact with material. Constructs of glass, metal, wood, or any real material are programmed by designing complicated multidimensional programs to cover an area called an Aetherial frame. Aside from constructs and animation the necromancy department is responsible for stationary constructs often referred to as enchanted objects. The Necromancy department assists in security, locating and correcting issues within programming, and the theory of programming the aforementioned constructs. - Blaise</p>
