<blockquote>
  <p>"Within this department alchemical research is conducted. Belthidian law is considered through Toristic processes of observation not too dissimilarity the scientific method. Concepts of the physical and metaphysical are described, applied, and further evaluated through the utilization of elementary alchemical components and use of equipment. This research is important not only for the creation of new products in several industries but allows for closer examination of the Belthidian laws on the material within the world. Proper tools, resources, and planar positional are all considered when examining these laws closely." - Blaise</p>

          <li>Genesis compounds</li>
          <li>Cryotics</li>
