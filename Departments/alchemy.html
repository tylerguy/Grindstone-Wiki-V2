<p><strong>[Note: Belthidian Laws are close to our Laws of Physics but include invention and interplay of the Divine(Gods) and Toristic Process is similar to the Scientific Method.]</strong></p>
<p>Alchemy, like other departments, study the Belthidian Laws and must research in accordance with what is understood to be true until it's proven false. It is not to be assumed that the spiritual component is not practical. The interplay of the Divine is accepted as important in both the examination of the temporal and material world, and the observations are necessary in the study of Alchemy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concepts of the physical and metaphysical are described, applied and evaluated through the utilization of elementary alchemical components and equipment to aid the Toristic process. The research is important for the creation of new products in several industries, but also allows for closer examination of the Belthidian laws on the material within the world. Gillie says defining the metaphysical is best described as the “study of causality”, despite being vague, and is analyzed by empirical research by Toristic process with experimentation, using theory and equipment as tools for investigating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Material properties are also important in Alchemy and recently, a construct was developed that suggests a direct relation to occupied space for some compounds and its observed properties.</p>
<p>Aetherial is utilized frequently in Alchemy, and there is an entire sub-specialty with a large focus on how aetherial might directly affect alchemical compounds. There have even been constructs created to assist in department studies.</p>
<h2>The Wheel</h2>
<p>There are more than a dozen proposed models for different situations in alchemical experimentation and it’s believed the examination of the elementary is not always practical, leading to the use of what Alchemy calls “The Wheel.” Though imperfect, it is used for general consideration and best guess in practical alchemy. It can be best described as eight segments, each representative of an alchemical property, with opposing properties across from each other.</p>
<p>According to the wheel, there are eight alchemical properties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fire</li>
  <li>Earth</li>
  <li>Air</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Life</li>
  <li>Death</li>
  <li>Abberant</li>
  <li>Power</li>
</ul>
<p>The properties align with observed natural phenomena and concepts based in religious studies. The observation is Toristic and empirical, but the logic often follows a form of symbolic logic, with results having reasonable accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wheel is also helpful in aiding the measure of another characteristic called <strong>Volatility. </strong>The spaces between alchemical properties suggest higher volatility when combined and “how much” can be assumed by measuring the distance and quality of the opposition properties. However, the wheel does not verify adhesion, which is described in a different model.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a proposed model that suggests 23 separate alchemical characteristics with a very complex interaction chart. It better explains some experimental results but has failed in some predictions made by the Wheel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Iatrochemistry</h2>
<ul>
  <li>seeks to provide chemical solutions to diseases and medical ailments.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aeromatics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Alchemical compounds that freely present in the air without visible volatility and contain a strong smell<ul>
      <li>Stinky, colorless</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A scent is perceived differently per species, suggesting it effects the physiology of a species differently</li>
  <li>Stronger scent is believed to be larger in size and have more area to buffer other scents</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable Aeromatics</h3>
<h4>Mint</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Synonymous with health</li>
  <li>Physicians can be recognized by mint in their hats, on their clothes or carrying it.</li>
  <li>Mint Cake<ul>
      <li>Very bitter, but can be sweetened</li>
      <li>Consumed in the house of the sick or those near bad air</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Miasma</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An imbalance in alchemical properties in the air, causing a foul smell and resulting in an imbalance in the physiology of those near it.<ul>
      <li>Power</li>
      <li>Aberrant</li>
      <li>Death</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Treatment requires extraction of fluids or the use of compounds<ul>
      <li>Compounds have various classifications<ul>
          <li>Genesis compounds</li>
          <li>Cryotics</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Dermal treatments is usually done when the compound is “heavy”<ul>
          <li>Aeromatics is the quickest application</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
