<h6>Pre-Lecture Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Technically a continuation of lecture 15. There will be a fresh subject tomorrow.</p>
  <p>I'll give is 30 minutes to ask questions. If no one asks until 15 after I'll just start.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald @JamesTischler </strong>(Do you mean by use of an aeonization expert or what a construct generally looks like?)</p>
  <p>what it looks like, i guess. How it takes up visible space, and how our eyes percieve it. but can you also elaborate on what you mean by use of an aeonization expert?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The naked eye doesn't perceive the frame actually. There are some instances of bad programming where rapid degradation might be visible because the emission causes heat and light.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>An aeonization expert however can see frames and aetherial marks however.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is this visible or through some other sense? can you describe what it looks like?</p>
  <p>and can you see them</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Visible absolutely. Are you asking about frames or aetherial marks?</p>
  <p><i><strong>emerald</strong></i></p>
  <p>both</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Heyyyy.... <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@UMAD-MANAGEMENT</span> does this count?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>blaise has been summoned</p>
  <p><strong>UMAD-MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
  <p>Close enough. 10 DPC to Necromancy for Emerald <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Infernal Affairs</span></p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Pays to ask questions.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>huh ok</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong></p>
  <p>?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>it seems theyve got a lecture question bingo card</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>So frames look like a white core with light blue around them for those who can see under the effects of the standard spells that allow for seeing frames but this is not universal and is dependent on what spell you are using. Generally it looks like a wire frame skeleton.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(it seems theyve got a lecture question bingo card)</p>
  <p>Something like that.</p>
  <p><strong>infin @UMAD-MANAGEMENT </strong>(Close enough. 10 DPC to Necromancy for Emerald <span class="mention" data-mention="undefined">@Infernal Affairs</span>)</p>
  <p>will do</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>:D</p>
  <p>time to make an artistic rendition in MS paint</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The aetherial mark is a signature unique to a aetherial efferent caster and generally looks like a small circular stamp with cross sectional or semi-cross sectional lines. Think a bar code that goes in 360 degrees.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>woahh</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The mark is a proof, a signature that is very difficult to replicate.</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong></p>
  <p>that's so cool!</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>It is one of the first things many casters prefer to learn, especially aetherial efferent casters.</p>
  <p>Anything else?</p>
  <p>I'm cool to keep answer questions if you have them before returning to lecture.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>so interference is a difference in aetherial waves?</p>
  <p>or something else</p>
  <p>also heres the ms paint drawing lol</p>
  <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:400px;"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892114420589817877/930993582423281714/unknown.png?width=400&amp;height=237" alt="Image"></figure>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Ah, you're thinking of wave interference not program interference. The idea of program interference does derive from wave interference.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>oh, so the waves of the aether mess up the programming lines</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>So the animated necro image that I'm having trouble uploading.</p>
  <p>If you look at it you will see lines that appear and disappear.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>also, are the aetherial marks left behind every time someone casts something? Or is it a separate spell that a caster might leave to sign a work</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Could one of my purple people upload it here?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is it the one posted in interal of the skull?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Yes</p>
  <p>That is a great way to show a frame within material.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <figure class="image"><img src="/comp_6.gif"></figure>
  <p>ooh i see</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(also, are the aetherial marks left behind every time someone casts something? Or is it a separate spell that a caster might leave to sign a work)</p>
  <p>An aetherial mark is not the same as residue or aura. It is a seperate and purposeful spell.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>ok</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Anything else about aetherial marks or frames?</p>
  <p>Please do ask questions. If I don't finish I'll just keep returning until I do</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>is the actual method of programming going to be talked about at length at some point?</p>
  <p>i dont remember the specifics how how lines are made be discussed</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>You are learning surveys at this time but eventually you'll learn process and early concepts. You need to learn quite a bit before you create your first construct like safety and how to even cast. The entire process will eventually be taught however.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>makes lots of sense</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Honestly what I'm teaching you now even Blaise could lecture on. Each topic has a number of survey lessons but beyond them you need a qualified expert. I'll be teaching through simple necromancy and then I'm sorta limited to aetherial mechanisms and theory. We can bring in an expert on full frames a heuristics though. They are the hard core math guys in programming.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are the heuristics you mention the same as the ones in our programming</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Heuristic Combat Capable Communications Reconnaissance and Tactical Applications Full Frame Construct is a theoretical concept and a dream of many programmers. Each little adjective there could be it's own research. As a communications guy I'm not only interested in the way we communicate or communication technologies but I'm also interested in how we interpret language cues. Syntax, Semantics, etc. A true Heuristic Communications Full Frame would pass what you call the Turing Test. At least if it was developed well enough.</p>
  <p>Such a thing is unfortunately fantasy.</p>
  <p>Though undead can have much more social nuance than a full frame typically.</p>
  <p>A Heuristic Construct can learn. That is the short answer to your question.</p>
  <p>Again, impractical.</p>
  <p>A Heuristic Construct finds patterns and constructs new lines in programming to adapt.</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse</strong></p>
  <p>This is why I'm confused about the terminology</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>What terminology might I be able to assist with?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>does pm-1 have their own version of a turing test</p>
  <p>do programmed undead retain their previous knowledge of language and social behaviors?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Not so much but maybe if I ever have the title Enchanter I can cast my humility to the side and call it the Tischler test.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>tischler test retains that nice alliteration</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @emerald </strong>(do programmed undead retain their previous knowledge of language and social behaviors?)</p>
  <p>This depends. There are things that are shortcut spells that can if done quickly enough to a newly deceased that lacks much damage.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>are you able to study to become an Enchanter like you might to become a doctor?</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Also some undead will retain some characteristics. This is all dependent on the manner of death, where they died, and how soon after death programming starts.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>huh ok</p>
  <p>no more questions from me i need to go</p>
  <p>thank you!</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Emerald had asked all my questions XD</strong></p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>The term Doctor means that who is learned. An Enchanter is much the same but in EXT-918 Doctors are much more numerous than they were a few hundred years ago. Such is the case in PM-1 now. Enchanters are very rare and the title very distinguished. They are polymaths who have done incredible things for their studies. I am a master of my study who can design aetherial mechanisms without assistance and cast known programming spells with expertise. I am however still a student of other fields and always learning more as I research.</p>

<h6>Degradation: Lead and Decay</h6>
<p>Picking up from where we left off.</p>
<p>Interference is not the only means of degradation. In addition to this a construct can degrade quickly through interaction with certain materials, the most destructive of which is lead. Lead seems to soak up aether like a sponge and not like letting go so when run across a program in free space it can distort or even delete the program where it was run through altogether. The destruction of the material will not necessarily destroy programming but depending on the programming if the construct is hit forcefully a contingent spell of thermokinetics might over compensate to allow it to continue to stand causing a fast and aggressive casting within the frame and speed up degradation in the relevant lines faster. While giving a few wacks to a full frame made of iron won't necessarily cause it to shut down, constant blunt force trauma to a full frame made for defensive purposes over a long period of time and with great force might eventually leave part of the full frame's material body to become immobile if the body itself hasn't sustained enough damage to not operate alone by then.</p>
<p>In necromantic programming degradation of the frames are not the only concerns you should have. The body also will decay and with the material body decaying it may lose connection at points with its programming or expose the programming to be deleted. Necromancers are often programming experts who have either connections or knowledge of how to preserve dead tissue. They are able to make corrections in programming easier than in metallic bodies however as they can simply cut into the tissue and administer led to areas that require deletion. Sometimes however new programming, especially that of thermokinetics for motility, might be necessary as the body degrades. It is for this reason a programmer will have to do much more maintenance on necromantic constructs than full frames once created. In theory and with unlimited time however piece by piece programming can be added and the old body removed until the necromantic construct is indistinguishable from a full frame.</p>
<p>I will break for a moment for questions then finally jump into the very basics, contingency casting.</p>
<h6>Break for Questions</h6>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Questions before moving on from degradation?</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>Nope. Last sentence answered mine</p>
  <p><strong>Mouse @JamesTischler </strong>(What terminology might I be able to assist with?)</p>
  <p>So, youre using construct to explain a physical or otherwise tangible thing in yesterday's lecture. But in today's lecture you're explaining construct a la Turing. And both of those cannot be true in the same sense</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong></p>
  <p>what exactly happens in the case of programming becoming disconnected from the material body? sorry if I worded this question poorly</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @Mouse </strong>(So, youre using construct to explain a physical or otherwise tangible thing in yesterday's lecture…)</p>
  <p>The construct exists as the material body and the the aetherial frame. The aetherial frame is a complex skeleton that exists dynamically through contingent casting. This can then mobilize through thermokinetics casting or other means the material body. The instructions and the skeleton are both one in the same but the skeleton is not material only that it can interact with the material.</p>
  <p><strong>@only_treble</strong></p>
  <p>what exactly happens in the case of programming becoming disconnected from the material body? sorry if I worded this question poorly</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Say you have a program that says "use thermokinetics to move object A at point X to point Y" where object A is a mass of stone. If object A is not within the field that the instructions of the thermokinetics spell designate to move then the spell is cast but nothing is there to move since object A is no longer where it was originally intended to be.</p>
  <p>Cut an arm off of a necromantic construct and chuck it elsewhere and then it is down an arm. You'll need to interrupt the frame and position the arm back before reactivating it for it to regain that motility.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Could giving a frame a good thwack make it work better lol</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong></p>
  <p>thank you!</p>
  <p><i><strong>JamesTischler</strong></i></p>
  <p>Maybe if it was out of alignment somehow.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Percussive maintenance &lt;3</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though you should be kind to your equipment and constructs.</p>
  <p>They take a lot of time to make.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>In your last line you mentioned replacing body parts, are they replaced with mechanical parts?</p>
  <p>Gave me ship of Theseus vibes</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble @emerald</strong> (Gave me ship of Theseus vibes)</p>
  <p>100 percent ship of theseus vibes</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Wax is common but nothing stops you from giving several iron bits motion.</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>What is the alignment tolerance on an average construct? Is it pure binary where it will only do what it does EXACTLY as you told it to do or will it adjust fractions to ensure a more efficient execution?</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></p>
  <p>^ very curious as to the answer to Dova's question (edited)</p>
  <p><strong>James Tischler @emerald (she/her)</strong> (Gave me ship of Theseus vibes)</p>
  <p>Exactly. Though there is a question if the initial animation not the slow removal of components makes the person something else as well. Most religious scholars would say yes.</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTishler @DovaDonut</strong> (What is the alignment tolerance on an average construct? …)</p>
  <p>Depends on how good a programmer you are. I use something called static redundancy lines and a series of lines that switch on and off under various circumstances.</p>
  <p>In short though the simplest frames are very particular.</p>
  <p>Aetherial Magic isn't smart, it's mechanical.</p>
  <p><strong>DovaDonut</strong></p>
  <p>So what im hearing is that if I am a good enough programmer, I could have a construct execute a simple chore multiple times and then randomly place an object in its path and it could recognize the object and avoid it?</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>Perhaps the object could clean floors and be a flat, cylindrical shape with collision detection?</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble @emerald</strong> (Perhaps the object could clean floors and be a flat, cylindrical shape with…)</p>
  <p>omg</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler @DovaDonut </strong>(So what im hearing is that if I am a good enough programmer, I could…)</p>
  <p>I'm going to introduce you to one of our program shortcuts. A spell designed and standardized. I'll do that in internal later though.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Asking for a friend of course</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>But yes, you are right Dova</p>
  <p>Yes you could have an aetherial roomba emerald.</p>
  <p><strong>emerald</strong></p>
  <p>:DDDD</p>
  <p><strong>only_treble</strong></p>
  <p><a href="/mp4.mp4">gif of a cat sitting on a Roomba</a></p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Though a regular one might be easier to build on EXT-918.</p>
  <p>Any other questions before we talk about contingency casting?</p>
  <p>Going once?</p>
  <p>Going Twice?</p>
  <p><strong>TheAutumnWriter</strong></p>
  <p>uhhhhhhh</p>
  <p>nope</p>
  <p><strong>JamesTischler</strong></p>
  <p>Alright then, back to lecture.</p>

<h6>Contingency Casting</h6>
<p>So many of you I'm sure want to get your construct up and running as fast as possible, unfortunately you'll need to learn to cast first. You should however know what you will be trying to do once you understand the basics of casting however. Lets look at the very basics and work our way up in structure starting with contingency casting and what it is.</p>
<p>As you know you aeonize, summate, and then give instructions to (program) a spell. To do this you utilize an aeonized object when in the weak area created by a four point. The aetherial matrix is fluid however and casting is very specific so summation has to change quickly with the understanding of how much aether is coming through the point of aeonization and if the rate may increase or decrease in the future. How do we predict the aetherial waves in the aetherial matrix? How do we calculate how much aether and at what rate is necessary for a casting? How do we account for time dilation in the 5-dimensional reality of the aetherial matrix? How do we adjust casting over time and in change of placement to the targeted area of a spell for a construct to function? To all but the latter most question I say to you, don't worry about that as another lecturer will talk about that with you.</p>
<p>The math gets heavy but there is something called the Motian (Mah-tee-uhn) Conjecture. This is a mathematical observance that doesn't have adequate proof but is used as a general rule of thumb when dealing with casting spells over long durations. To continue the casting however we need to conduct a special type of casting, the contingency casting.</p>
<p>Contingency casting is series casting, that is it is technically several spells linked together with small variable sections. The variable sections are altered depending on need or intention. You might recognize something similar in an earlier lecture and for good reason. Essentially a programmer needs to have a spell that aeonizes summates with regularity indicate a need for constant casting on top of casting according to select variables.</p>
<p>By ordering contingency casting you can create a simple program, a spell that casts spells effectively. Number hundreds of these together and in space they form a line. Under the assistance of aeonization magic this line is the aetherial frame of a construct. The Motian Conjecture is useless alone for casting over time. You also need to account for several other principals in casting to determine the placement of these complex contingency castings or simple programs. This is where I recommend you look back on an earlier lecture by Pauchik.</p>
<p>I will take questions</p>

  <h2>JamesTischler<i> — </i>01/12/2022</h2>
  <p>It varies depending on need but a typical contingent casting created to be in circuit for the purposes of motility in a full frame construct is about 4-6 at a time. It may seem intimidating when adding them all up but remember, like mathematicians we are lazy and have created several shortcuts.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately that is something that will need to be kept within the internal chat and we will need to find where you are in mathematics to properly explain it.</p>

  <h2>JamesTischler<i> — </i>01/12/2022</h2>
  <p>Don't misunderstand, what I mean is that you want to repeat something and predict changes over long time periods with consistency to the casting. Constructs are expensive and time consuming so you'd hope they would last as long as possible.</p>

  <p>For someone to actually cast a spell outside of a ritual I don't know anyone who would sit there with that level of intensity for longer than a part.</p>
