<p>Cultural Studies, often called Culture, is one of the largest departments at UMAD based on the number of subjects studied within it. There has been consideration of separating the department in the future, though currently all of the studies remain under Culture.</p>
<ul>
  <li>History</li>
  <li>Communications</li>
  <li>Religion</li>
  <li>Economics</li>
  <li>Politics</li>
  <li>Many others</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the department is to understand the interactions, motivations and behavior of people with social research and experimentation.</p>
