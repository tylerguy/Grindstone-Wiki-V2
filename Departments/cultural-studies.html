<blockquote>
  <p><i>"Cultural Studies, often simply called Culture, is currently one of the largest departments within UMAD due to the number of subjects examined here. The study of history, communications, religion, economics, politics, and many others are found within this department. While there has been consideration of separating this department in the future all these studies remain within a single department as it is the goal of the department to understand the interactions, motivations, and behavior of people. Both social research and experimentation is conducted here." - Blaise</i></p>
