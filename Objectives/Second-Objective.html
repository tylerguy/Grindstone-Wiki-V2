          <p style="text-align:center;">Dear applicant,</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;We are pleased to inform you that the second phase of mission two is now live. This new mission is different from any previous objectives you’ve been assigned.&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">We decided to send you into the world of [REDACTED] where the Universal Magical Academy at Dial has previously [REDACTED]. This is simply a extraplanar *simulation* utilizing a medium in your world.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">We have left your first clue at the bottom of this page.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;">Good luck.</p>

<h2>The Minecraft Server</h2>
<p>The creation of a Minecraft server was announced <i>before</i> the second phase, and is referenced within the description as “the simulation.” The world seems to be a simulation of a plane with the designation of EXT-111, there are many ruins and shrines that are dotted around the map, as well as quite a few books with lecterns that contain lore, seemingly from a researcher who went mad. There are also all sorts of strange phenomena that have been happen around the server the Blaise had explained to be included in the simulation due to the fact that such things have also happened on the plane, however there are things that have been happening that they didn’t account for, and don’t know who was responsible for. The origins of such things are unknown at the current moment, but they are attributed to what have been dubbed as “Watchers” who lead people to secrets using trails of fire and ice, as well as spawning waves on monsters as tests for the applicants who are on their ‘adventure’ at the current moment.</p>
