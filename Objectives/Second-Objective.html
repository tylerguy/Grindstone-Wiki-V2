<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Throughout this Objective, applicants were tasked with locating a set of four letters throughout several different Phases. The task necessitated locating several hidden codes both on the old version of the <a href="https://projectgrindstone.net/">official Grindstone website</a> and <a href="/Info/EXT-111">EXT-111 Minecraft Simulation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants collected the letters “F, K, R, and I," rearranging them to spell the name of one of <a href="/Info/The-Great-8">The Great Eight Gods, Frik</a>. Applicants were able to submit this name on the Grindstone website's Second Objective page.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Phase 1</h1>
<h3>FAQ&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Applicants located a &nbsp;message hidden within the FAQ page of the old version of the Grindstone website:</p>

<h2>The Minecraft Server</h2>
<p>The creation of a Minecraft server was announced <i>before</i> the second phase, and is referenced within the description as “the simulation.” The world seems to be a simulation of a plane with the designation of EXT-111, there are many ruins and shrines that are dotted around the map, as well as quite a few books with lecterns that contain lore, seemingly from a researcher who went mad. There are also all sorts of strange phenomena that have been happen around the server the Blaise had explained to be included in the simulation due to the fact that such things have also happened on the plane, however there are things that have been happening that they didn’t account for, and don’t know who was responsible for. The origins of such things are unknown at the current moment, but they are attributed to what have been dubbed as “Watchers” who lead people to secrets using trails of fire and ice, as well as spawning waves on monsters as tests for the applicants who are on their ‘adventure’ at the current moment.</p>
