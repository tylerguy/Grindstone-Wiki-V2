<h1>Phase 1</h1>
<p>The email for puzzle 3 was released September 24th, 2021 ~8:31 PM EST. (note that the URL for Puzzle 3 was initially missing a ‘C’ from ‘Obje<strong>c</strong>tive’.</p>

<p>Appearing approximately at the same time on the website was a <a href="https://www.projectgrindstone.net/culture"><u>Cultural Studies</u></a> page and a .7z file containing a gallery of 6 images. Several of the images appear elsewhere on the site as banners.</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.jpg is an image of a kiln</li>
  <li>2.jpg is an image of a room or study and appears on the <a href="https://www.projectgrindstone.net/privacy-policy"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a> page.</li>
  <li>3.pg is a landscape shot and appears on the <a href="https://www.projectgrindstone.net/404"><u>404 page</u></a>.</li>
  <li>4.jpg is an image of dolls or scarecrows dangling from an ominous tree, and appears on the <a href="https://www.projectgrindstone.net/"><u>main page</u></a>.</li>
  <li>5.jpg appears to be a granary or storage room of some kind</li>
  <li>6.jpg</li>
</ul>
<p>If the images are read as text files, parts of a message can be found at the bottom of 1.jpg, 2.jpg, and 3.jpg. When strung together, they read as:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is yet to find the mysterious mystery that is somewhere to be found. Who shall find this who knows as the fair people say that one simply isn't enough.</li>
    <li>We are searching everywhere to find it. Have you discovered it yet? <strong>l</strong>ook to the place you think it may be and you may just find it.</li>
    <li>We are sending you out into your plane to discover a secret we have hidden for you. This will be just like when [REDACTED] traveled to [REDACTED] and discovered [REDACTED]</li>
    <li>This will require you to [REDACTED] Await further instructions to discover where you to start. A message will be coming to you in 7 cycles with further instructions.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cultural Studies Gallery includes a picture of a Mine, but it is not present in the Gallery itself.</p>

<h1>Phase 2</h1>
<p>Part two has 8 video files (numbered 1-8), with various images and music. There is morse code in the background of all of them; we are working on transcribing and rearranging it. Letters were found to correspond to each of the 8 files [i couldn’t follow how this was uncovered, someone supplement my account and then delete this little note -nobody].(( At this point we hypothesize the letters order the 8 fragments into a hopefully coherent text, possibly a conversation))</p>
<p>Morse code isolated, mostly (quieter morse code may not be present, please double check with raw audio) - Chuck: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EfNggacpQaJaWrADi2m6m5NsoEze-DOw?usp=sharing"><u>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EfNggacpQaJaWrADi2m6m5NsoEze-DOw?usp=sharing</u></a></p>

<p>Working Backwards:</p>
<p>You are to simply send the message “I’m ready to know” for further instructions. On a night tell this number what. 1-513-854-0447</p>
<h3>Part 2:</h3>
<p>Texting</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I'm ready to know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the phone number (1-513-854-0447 results in a response of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your answer is within</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a file being sent to your phone.</p>
<p>The .rtf file reads</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Follow the champion, mounted atop regal steed, with gleaming steel in hand.</p>
  <p>Rising sun glinting upon iron hides as they survey those whom they command.</p>
  <p>From the soldiers striding rank and file, flanked by columned cavalry;</p>
  <p>City’s center drums with the boots of parading soldiers drunk on wine of victory.</p>
  <p>And you who cower amidst crumbling walls, who pray to all divines below and above</p>
  <p>Will find your prayers unheard, who lived life for self instead of just and godly love.</p>
  <p>That which was heavily imbibed was the wine of life, drawn from the poor and underclass,</p>
  <p>You’ve sought to liberate from swollen bellies, as you lay them out entrail’d and unmasked.</p>
  <p>In the wake of such conquest the streets become soaked with the crimson of this bloody path.</p>
  <p>Lands there are torn asunder and the holy men fall upon the sword and justice of your wrath.</p>

<p>Following this instructions using landmarks on the minecraft server leads you to a partial wall, from where we discovered a secret area underneath where we found the locations:</p>

<h1>Phase 3:</h1>
<p>From the email receive a week later:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/screenshot_2021-10-20_170058.png"></figure>
<p>Additional email from 2021-10-26</p>

<h2>Locations:</h2>
<p>The secret found at each game &amp; comic store location is a framed artwork print of images found in Culture Studies at <a href="https://www.projectgrindstone.net/culture">ProjectGrindstone.net</a>. The back of each print are signed by a social media influencer involved with Proj: Grindstone and include a symbol &amp; number CLUE.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bristol - Toyville<ul>
      <li>Clue: .4</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Birmingham - Games HQ<ul>
      <li>Clue: 7/</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Los Angeles - Turn Zero Games<ul>
      <li>Clue: /9</li>

  <li>Seattle - Dpad retro gaming:<ul>
      <li>Clue: 8:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Atlanta - Challenges Games &amp; Comics:<ul>
      <li>Clue: 7-</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vancouver - Drexol Games<ul>
      <li>Clue: 8.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Edmonton - The Clumsy Dragon Tabletop Guild<ul>
      <li>Clue not retrieved.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Kuala Lumpur - We play games CAFE<ul>
      <li>Clue: -2</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Whenever the numbers with similar symbols are put back to back, you are given:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">| 8..4 | 7..9 | 8::? | 7--2 | (84, 79, 8?, 72)</p>
<p>If the unknown number is presumed to be 2, this translates to TORH, which unscrambled creates the name ROHT, the Dialian god of war. This follows previous puzzles’ pattern of the answer being a Dialian god (specifically one of the Great Eight) and is currently the best guess we have for the answer to puzzle 3. The submission box opened later that same day we found the answer.</p>
