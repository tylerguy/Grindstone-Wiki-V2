<p>On the Discord, applicants were instructed that completion of the REEEEE was necessary for assignment to the Accelerated Researcher Track [ART]. In addition, they were informed that not all answers to questions would be accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Blaise:</p>
  <p>UMAD REEEEE update: The examination will have questions taken at random from subjects within the original UMAD REEEEE. This is true for the bulk of the test but also new questions have been written specifically for your applicant pool. You may find this test difficult and not all content easily accessible. We have noted this and wish you the best with your examination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 4th, the UMAD REEEEE was released for applicant access via an email from Janet. Applicants had from November 4th to November 15th to complete the 100-question examination.&nbsp;</p>
