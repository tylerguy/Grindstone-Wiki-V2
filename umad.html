<h2 style="text-align:center;">History</h2>
<p>&nbsp;During the conception of Dial, education facilities with entry by application or lottery were accounted for in their city plan. In the center of Dial, an establishment was to be created for the advancement of military defense as well as public education, and would provide public access to unrestricted education of Aetherial Studies as long as application exams were passed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the old education model of Academia, the concepts taught within the walls would not have religious restriction and would not condemn the study of any one aetherial school.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align:center;">“Thus it was Universal in it's teachings of Magic and established itself in a system similar to the Academia and located within the walls of Dial.” - Bruno Gelehrte</p>
