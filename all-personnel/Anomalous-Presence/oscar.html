<h2>Interception</h2>
<p>A player contacted Oscar via his company email address claiming he wants to invest into the company. He was able to gain Oscar's trust (see emails below). Oscar finally agreed to meet in person on 4th March, 2022 at Riverside Plaza, California. IA has been informed and was able to intercept Oscar at the meeting place.</p>

<p>February 25, 2022 (to Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  <p>Interesting website. Can you give me some more information about investment in services and products you provide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>February 28, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Mr. Broom,</p>
  <p>That is very interesting. Some question:</p>
  <p>- is there a limit regarding investment? I indeed plan to invest a eight-digit amount in cryto. Currency</p>
  <p>- how will be the price be settled in future? I mean how do you ensure, that it is hard to produce new Crypto coins?</p>
  <p>- if I decide to invest a amount as big as planned, I guess it would be helpful to meet in person. I can easily fly to LA. That”s your base, right? Or any other place. What would be best option regarding a personal meeting point?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>February 28, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear interested investor,</p>
  <p>There is no limit on how much you are allowed to invest. The the more you have, the more you would earn in the future. &nbsp;We make the coins ourselves so there it is ensure the coin will continue being reliable. There is no need for an in person meeting to discuss investments. If you wish to invest you can send the money to the address in our website and after we confirm the amount is correct, you will receive the corresponding amount of CoSeam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>February 28, 2022 (to Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Mr. Broom,</p>
  <p>To be honest, I am a little bit confused and not sure anymore that your business is a serious one. It is very unusual that a company expects investors/partners to send a bigger amount of money while only having some email exchange. In this business you will only be successful if you build up connections based on trust.</p>
  <p>So usually I meet my business partners several times before I invest my money with them.</p>
  <p>Your business idea seems a little bit suspicious &nbsp;or at least it seems you are not very experienced in this field of business.</p>
  <p>So I guess, I will not be able to invest into your business based on the information I have up to now</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 1, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Esteemed,</p>
  <p>We agree trust is important for these types of businesses, and that both of us could benefit from this investment. We could arrange a meeting a meeting to exchange more information. Please let us know of your availability so we can find something that suits us both.</p>
  <p>We guarantee that our business is a valid one and there is nothing to worry about. We have been advised by the best internet advisors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 1, 2022 (to Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Partner,</p>
  <p>That sounds promising. My assistant can arrange a meeting on Thursday or Friday afternoon 3/4 March). If this is in too short term for you: next Tuesday or Thursday would also still be possible.</p>
  <p>Do you have a location in mind? So I could arrange the travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 2, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear investor,</p>
  <p>Our schedule should be free for this Friday, we can meet at the Riverside Plaza, California, to discuss business. If this doesn't sound good for you, we can move the place and date to something that suits you better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 2, 2022 (to Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Riverside Plaza sounds good. I looked up the area. There is a fountain in front of a sushi restaurant. We might meet at the fountain and have a business lunch at the sushi restaurant - if you like or any other restaurant.</p>
  <p>Is 2pm local time suitable for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 2, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2pm is available in our schedule, we shall meet at the sushi place in front of the fountain. I will be expecting you there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the others warned Oscar he got suspicious and wrote</p>
<p>March 2, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear investor,</p>
  <p>Some of our advisors expressed concerns about the legitimacy of your investment. We would like to know more about who you are and what kind of investments do you make. Trust is important and we want to be able to fully trust you.</p>
  <p>We apologize for the inconvenience</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 2, 2022 (to Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Mr. Broom,</p>
  <p>That is exactly the reason for a first face to face meeting: to ask the right questions.</p>
  <p>I do not fully understand your concerns, because you have nothing to loose, besides an investor, right? Or is your business based on some shady activities ;-)</p>
  <p>Here are some basic information:</p>
  <p>I made some good money by investing a “small“ amount of money into Bitcoins in 2011, where a prices were below 10 $.</p>
  <p>This success was not planned but allowed me to start my career as business angel. In the meantime I had many unsuccessful investments, but also some really good ones:</p>
  <p>Nubank, Brex, Coinbase (as examples).</p>
  <p>So my portfolio is mainly set in the area of Fintech.</p>
  <p>I am member of several business angel clubs, which provide information about startups. One ongoing investment I look into is this one:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.us/business-proposals/shekel-world-coin-15-1223645"><u>https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.us/business-proposals/shekel-world-coin-15-1223645</u></a></p>
  <p>On the other hand I like to have investment opportunities, that are „outside“ of the typical „make a pitch and post it in some business angel club“ idea. Risk but also opportunities are higher. That‘s why I am interested in CoSeam.</p>
  <p>Does this information help? Is the meeting now settled, cancelled, shifted?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 3, 2022 (from Oscar)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for providing the information we needed, we will indeed continue forward with the meeting on Friday. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>IA - the interception</h2>
<p>So the meeting was scheduled and IA has been informed:</p>
<p>March 1, 2022 (to Tomás Saltator, IA) - the suspicous interplay (see above) happened afterwars, but played out well.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Internal Affairs: Meeting with Oscar is settled: Date: Friday, 4th MarchTime: 2 pmLocation: in front of the fountain at the Sushi Restaurant at Riverside Plaza,</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>March 1, 2022 (from Tomás Saltator, IA)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We applaud your commitment to locating the anomalous individuals currently jeopardizing the security of the Universal Magical Academy at Dial’s initiatives on EXT-918.</p>
  <p>If you determine a time and location for Oscar to arrive at a specified area, we will organize to intercept. So long as the information relevant to the exact location of the meeting is provided to Infernal Affairs, we will handle acquisition of the targets. This applies to all of the recognized security threats—preliminary analysis of their suspected general locations has informed us that interception is feasible even with limited notice.</p>
  <p>Felix will not be involved in interception of targets. Per our discussed arrangement, we will not be collecting Felix until all anomalous individuals have been intercepted.</p>
