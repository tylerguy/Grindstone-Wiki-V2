<h1>The Tales of Layora</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>posted on February 24, 2022</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hello everybody I hope you enjoy this story I have been writing this is the first chaper!! 😊 😊 I will post more but I have to type it out because I wrote it on paper. I really like the fantasy stories I have read so please enjoy mine 🥰</p>
  <p>Layora was an ordinary warrior born in the land of Balthes and made to train for the military since she was very young. But once while training with her friends the world changed around them and they were suddenly transported into a new strange land with that was very different. She was the first to wake up after the shock of being transported to a new place and she gasped and grabbed her sword and looked around to make sure there was no danger. They had all been laying in a grassy field but now there was only four of her friends in the grass as Layora looked around. In the distence she could see a city but it looked very different from the cities of Balthes with much taller buildings and strange roads. In fact all around her there seemed to be cities but the one she saw first did seemed to be the biggest.</p>
  <p>She sat down, and waited for her friends to wake up because she didn't want to wake them up if they were still recovering from the sudden travel. She frowned and played with the grass and looked around, wondering how they would ever find a way to go home. Suddenly another one of her friends woke up, a man named Finn who had been assigned to training her group for the war back in Balthes. Finn seemed grumpy and confused and looked more scared the more he looked around. "Where are we Layora? Are you alright?" He asked while frowning and looked even more confused when he saw the big city. "Yes I'm okay but I don't know about our friends, my head still hurts but I have my sword in case there's any danger!" Finn seemed less grumpy when Layora said this but he still shook his head.</p>
  <p>Layora said "I think we should be caerful but we should probably go to the city and see where we are and find a way home. Because I don't think we're home anymore because those buildings look really different to the ones in Balthes." Finn agreed as another one of Layora's friends woke up and complained about feeling ill. His name was Oliver and he was almost as old as Finn and a very good hunter but not a very good fighter. Layora went over to help him stand up and gave him a hug because he seemed upset and confused. "Oliver are you okay? We're confused too, I don't think we're still in Balthes, and we all just woke up here feeling confused." Oliver nodded. "Yeah I'm okay, thanks Layora. You said we're not in Balthes? Where are we?" Layora shrugged and apologized. "I don't know where we are yet but things look pretty different, there's a bunch of cities I've never seen before and all the buildings are way taller than I remember." Oliver agreed while Layora noticed Finn was walking towards a small forest behind them. "Where are you going Finn?" She asked as Finn kept walking. Finn said "I'm going to go look for anything we can eat while we wait for Cecilie and Kay to wake up." Layora agreed that this was a good idea and sat down because she was starting to feel dizzy. She couldn't remember when she last ate and traveling to a whole different world probably didn't help. She hoped they even had food they could eat.</p>
  <p>Suddenly she heard a scream as Finn ran out of the woods and she jumped up grabbing her sword. "Finn, what's wrong?" She yelled but she saw as Finn ran that behind him was a giant hairy monster with long teeth and sharp claws! She ran towards the monster with her sword and stood in front of her friends that were still sleeping bravely. "I won't let you hurt my friends!" She yelled at the creature and pointed her sword at it as Oliver and Finn looked scared. They didn't have their weapons so they could only watch as the monster jumped towards Layora but she dodged to a side as the monster tried to bite her. She struck it with her sword and the creature seemed angry as it tried to bite her then claw her but she barely avoided both attacks and stabbed it again. She was almost attacked but she was able to dodge at the last second and kill the monster with a sword stab through its back and the monster fell to the ground dead. Oliver cheered while Finn walked over to it to poke it and make sure it was really dead, and it was. Then Finn asked to borrow Layora's sword so they could eat it and Layora agreed, starting a fire with Olivers help while they waited for Finn to get the meat.</p>
  <p>As they were cooking the meat and Layora was still guarding her friends looking for other dangers, Cecilie finally woke up with a groan. Layora was excited and went to make sure she was okay and she was, just dizzy. Cecilie looked around and was confused about where they were so Layora explained what happened and how they were attacked by a giant creature but Layora saved them, and now they were waiting for Kay to wake up. They joined Oliver and Finn at the fire when the meat was done cooking and they ate to make sure they had energy to keep fighting and for the long trip to the city they would have to make to get information. Finn had decided they should go do research to try to find a way back to their home and Layora agreed but they had to be careful. Finally they all went to sleep with Layora guarding and the next interval Kay finally woke up. They explained everything to Kay who seemed upset but not as grumpy as Finn and then they finally started going towards the big city that Layora had seen the day before.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Posted on February 27, 2022</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ere is the second part of the story I wrote!! I hope you guys like it 🥰😊</p>
  <p>After a long walk Layora and her friends finally made it to the big city. There were other cities they could have gone to but they chose the biggest one because they wanted to figure out more about where they were. Finn said they should be careful because they didn't know if the people in this place were friendly or not. Layora guessed he was just scared after the creature had attacked them so she reassured him that she would protect them from any danger.</p>
  <p>They entered the city to find everybody wearing different clothes from them and people looked at them confused but nobody attacked them so Layora put her sword away. They walked around looking at the city for a while and the buildings were very tall and they had to crane there necks to look up at them. Most of the buildings had signs in front of them and they were all confused to see that the language seemed similar to there's but some of the words were weird. Layora saw Kay leave the group for a second and she watched as he walked over to a group of people and said something to them. She stopped and the rest of the group stopped to waiting for Kay to finish talking. He finally walked back over to the group and said "They speak Subterran just like us. They said this place is called Cagochi and they asked if we were something called cause players. I said yes and they looked understanding so I think we should call ourselves that if anybody asks." Layora nodded and said "Good thinking Kay!"</p>
  <p>They kept walking and exploring but Layora noticed that Cecilie was falling behind the group so she went to go talk to her. "Hey Cecilie everything ok?" Layora asked and Cecilie put a hand on her stomach. "No I'm starting to get hungry and my head still hurts from when we woke up in the field yestarday. But we don't have any currency or anything to trade." Layora thought for a minute and then looked at the rest of the group. "Is anybody else hungry?" She asked and everyone nodded. She looked around and saw a small box on the corner of a walking path that had a cover over the top and wheels on the bottom. She saw some people eating around the box and a person wearing colorful clothes standing behind it. She waved to her friends and said too follow her and they walked over to the cart on wheels, seeing that they seemed to be selling bread and meat.</p>
  <p>The man said "What can I get you guys?" And Layora asked what they sold. The man said they sold hot dogs and Layora asked for one for each of the group members. He made the food but before he gave it to them he looked at them like he wanted something and Layora looked away sadly saying "Sorry but we don't have anything to trade, is there anything we can do for you for the food?" The man looked confused but before he could say anything Layora heard a voice from behind her and a man walked towards them. He walked over too the man with the food and said "Don't worry I'll pay for their food" and handed the man a few green sheets of paper. He still seemed confused but this at least made him give the food to them and Layora handed the food to everyone as she went to ask the man some questions. She looked over at him and gasped as she recognized him as their friend from Balthes!! "Nico is that you?! What are you doing here???" She asked surprized.</p>
  <p>Nico waved and smiled and said "I didn't know you guys were sent here too! I must have woken up before you, I woke up here a week ago and saw this city so I went to it and I've been trying to learn about it since. I recognized you guys from your clothes while I was asking people for spare currency, that's how I could pay for your food. You should come with me, I have a place where I've been sleeping since I got here. I can tell you what I've learned." She smiled and noticed that Finn was watching them talk and he walked over and said "I didn't know you were here too Nico, I've been thinking and I think we got here through a random occurence. It can be hard on our bodies to travel like that so I guess you recovared before us. You should take us to where you have been staying." They all agreed and they followed Nico a long way through the walking paths and out of the area with the big buildings into an area with smaller houses that looked almost similar to buildings in Balthes. He led them into one house that seemed damaged with broken windows and holes in the outside. Inside Nico seemed to have a small stash of food and some clothes that seemed like what they had seen the people wearing inside the city. "Woah where did you get all this?" Asked Oliver looking immpressed. Nico smiled and said "Well I didn't have any currency so I had to borrow some stuff, there's a lot of people in Cagochi so if you're careful they won't notice. I talked too some people who said sometimes people will give you the currency here if you ask so I tried that and got some of the currency, it seems to be green paper and coins here. The same people told me I can find a place to stay here since there's a lot of houses that are abandonned if you are careful not to get caught. This place seems hard to live in so we just have to be careful." Everybody agreed and seemed too relax more now that they had a place to stay and learned more about the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Posted on March 11, 2022</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey guys... this isn't really Chapter 3 but I was feeling sad so I felt like writing a different part of the story so I wasn't sure what to call it... I hope you still enjoy ❤️❤️❤️ Let me know what you think! ❤️</p>
  <p>After a few weeks of living in Cagochi Layora and her friends were finally starting to feel more comfortable and Nico was helping them a lot to get them food and clothes and shelter. It was cold in the house because of the holes in the walls but they had warm clothes that helped keep them warm and padded bags where they could sleep. One night while Layora was sleeping she started dreaming about Cagochi and living there a few years later.</p>
  <p>Layora dreamed that in the future Finn really wanted to go back to Balthes because he didn't like living in Cagochi but all her other friends liked living there a lot. Suddenly Finn found out about a secret group that had been sent to Cagochi to find her and her friends and take them home! Finn told the secret group where Layora and all her friends were, but they liked living in Cagochi and didn't want too go back to Balthes. Layora went too stay in a hotel so Felix wouldn't tell the scary group where she lived because then they would try to take her back to Balthes, and in this dream she worked in a library that she really liked. So her friends were all avoiding Finn so that he wouldn't be able too take them to Balthes because Cagochi was there new home. But somehow Finn found out where Oliver was and Nico sent her a letter saying Oliver had been captured!!!</p>
  <p>Layora was really upset by this news, how could Finn have captured Oliver?! She felt bad that Finn wanted too go back to Balthes so badly but she was confused about why he would try to take them all back with him. To think better about what happened she decided too go to the park near by her hotel for a walk like she had been doing every morning before she went to work at the library. It helped her think better beacuse the hotel was small and made her lonely without her friends. She went too the park and found her usual spot near the big fountain, and she wished again that she could see it when it was on, but it was still too cold for it to be on. This usually made her sad because the fountain was really pretty and she would have liked to see it running, but today she was glad that it was off because the park was quiet and it helped her too think about what to do. She was sad about Oliver but suddenly she had an idea... what if she went to rescue Oliver? She had to come up with a plan but she thought she knew how she could find him.</p>
  <p>Layora went back too her apartment that she shared with Finn and her friends and knocked on the door hoping Finn was home. Finn opened the door and looked surprised to see her but she waved. "Hi Finn... I changed my mind... I think your right and I want to go back to Balthes." Finn looked like he was happy at this news. "Its about time Layora, if only the others had your sense. I will tell the group that you want too go back and they will come get you." Layora agreed and Finn asked her for the location of the library she worked at and told her too go wait there. Layora said goodbye to Finn and went to go wait at the library and after a while a black square car drove up and some people came out and waved for Layora to get in the car. Layora got in the car and they put a blind fold on her.</p>
  <p>It felt like they were driving forever but finally the car stopped and the people led Layora out of the car and into a small room that looked like a hotel. Inside the room was Oliver!! Oliver looked sad but he looked surprised when he saw her. He jumped up and went over to her "Layora! Did they get you too?" She looked at the two people guarding the door and she whispered "No Oliver I'm here too rescue you!" She lifted her shirt without the guards seeing so Oscar could see that she hid her sword beneath her clothes!! The secret group probably didn't know that she was a trained warrior from Balthes! "I don't want too kill the guards but maybe we can knock them out and escape. Can you cause a distraction?" Layora whispered too Oliver. He nodded and walked over too the window and gasped loudly looking over at the gaurds "Hey!!! I see Nico walking out there! He's from Balthes too!" The guards looked at each other and walked over to where Oliver was to see what he was pointing at. When they walked past Layora she quickly took the sword out from under her clothes and snuck up behind the first guard and hit him hard in the back of the head with the hilt. It was heavy and metal so the guard passed out. The other guard looked at her in fear and it didn't seem like he had any weapons so Layora pointed the sword at him. "Just let us go and I won't kill you, I don't want too kill anyone, please just let us go home!" The guard slowly nodded and stepped away with his hands raised and Layora grabbed Oliver's hand and led them out the door. They ran out of the hotel and they weren't sure where they were but they found a bus stop and decided to take the bus for as far away as it would go from the hotel where they were being kept. They still didn't know where they were but they were able too get off the bus and find another hotel after walking a few miles where they were finally able to relax. They would have too find a way back to Cagochi but it seemed possible but Layora was tired.</p>
  <p>As she layed down and closed her eyes in the dream she finally woke up from the long dream. She looked around too see all her friends still sleeping and she felt relaxed knowing it was just a dream that they were all fighting. She yawned and went back too sleep feeling a lot better.</p>

<h2>IA - the interception</h2>
<p>March 15, 2022 (to Tomás Saltator, IA)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Tomas,</p>
  <p>Just a wild guess:</p>
  <p>Zoey writes short stories which has true elements regarding their own story.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>She wrote that she is in Cagochi, which is a anagram of Chicago. She tells us she often visits a fountain in a park. In Chicago there is the&nbsp;<strong>Buckingham Fountain.&nbsp;</strong>It is “closed” in Wintertime and fits the description of Zoey:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“&nbsp;She went too the park and found her usual spot near the big fountain, and she wished again that she could see it when it was on, but it was still too cold for it to be on.”</p>
  <p>She works in a library nearby. But there are too many different ones to specify which she is working at.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But maybe a team might observe the fountain/park to track down Zoey. What do you think?</p>
