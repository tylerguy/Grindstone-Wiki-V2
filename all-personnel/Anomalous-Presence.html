<h1>Anomalous Presence</h1>
<p>On February 25, 2022 Felix joined the Discord server and due to his reddit account we found infos (reddit accounts) about 5 other people from PM-1 that “stranded” on EXT-918 (our world) due to a random planar overlay. Felix is the one that wants to return to PM-1, but the other 5 people do not want to return.</p>

<h2>Messages from Infernal Affairs</h2>
<p>on February 27, 2022 Tomás Saltator from Infernal Affairs (IA) emailed:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Forwarded from the desk of Janet: &nbsp;Following a careful review of known information concerning the anomalous presence of PM-1 natives on EXT-918, Infernal Affairs requests the urgent location of all recorded members of the Order of the Magus subsisting within your plane.</p>
  <p>All personnel of the Universal Magical Academy at Dial are hereby authorized to interact directly with the following individuals to obtain positional information necessary for interception: Caria Octobrius, Kai Exupermus, Nolan Lumiere, Oscar Broom, Zoey Silesius.</p>
  <p>While you are granted permission to directly engage with the aforementioned individuals, Infernal Affairs strongly advises caution and discretion when pursuing communication. Behavioral analyses have demonstrated that the individuals are highly cautious and reactive to activity they deem suspicious. Careful, communal strategizing is recommended prior to engaging directly with the noted security threats to ensure opportunities for collection of crucial information are not compromised.</p>
  <p>Utilize available resources to gain insight into each individual and endeavor to acquire their specific locations. Once a location has been obtained, forward all relevant information to a member of Infernal Affairs so that interception of security threats may be coordinated by the Universal Magical Academy at Dial. Additionally, continue routine monitoring of social media activity and immediately report any content that may further compromise security.</p>
  <p>- Tomás Saltator, Infernal Affairs &nbsp;</p>
