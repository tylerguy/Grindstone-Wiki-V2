<h1>Anomalous Presence</h1>
<p>Six members of the Order of the Magus (OotM), an organization from PM-1, was discovered to have been trapped on EXT-918 for about a decade. One of these members, Felix Neumann, has discovered the existence of UMAD through Reddit and is asking for their help to locate the five other members so that they may return to PM-1.</p>
<p>Employees and applicants alike are asked to help identify any classified data that these five have shared on Reddit concerning PM-1 and bring notice to them.</p>
<p>Felix believes it necessary to return to PM-1 due to illicit activities the gang has performed on EXT-918 in order to live here, since they had nothing to work with.</p>
<h1>The six people</h1>
<p>On February 25, 2022 Felix joined the Discord server and due to his reddit account we found infos (reddit accounts) about 5 other people from PM-1 that “stranded” on EXT-918 (our world) due to a random planar overlay. Felix is the one that wants to return to PM-1, but the other 5 people do not want to return.</p>

  <p>Hi Caria <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Affectionate_Low6864/"><u>u/Affectionate_Low6864</u></a>, I hope you will find this post okay! How are you liking your new phone and Reddit? Have you downloaded any other apps? How is Indiana? We have been thinking about you and we hope you have settled in well. I had lunch with Oscar and Kai and convinced them both to start using Reddit, and I think they got Zoey to make one too. We can all talk here together to keep in touch more easily now! I like how you can make a custom character that shows up next to your comments, haha. Let me know if you need any help setting up your profile.</p>

<h3>How do I start a business?</h3>
<p>[06:58:14 PM EST February 5th, 2022] [Oscar - CoSeamCreator] [r/smallbusiness]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to make my own cryptocurrency and I need help on how to set up a business. I've been seeing these ads about crypto and NFTs and I wanted to know how I can make my own and be successful like them. I have a name and a design in mind, I just need to know how the selling works.</p>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[deleted] [07:55:28 PM EST February 5th, 2022]</strong>: Food for thought questions to consider before going forward…</li>
    <li>umm, what kind of crypto? some weird shitcoin that has no inherent functionality, or value, or something else that has actual transactional functionality? Are you thinking about starting an exchange, or? Setting up a business is pretty easy be it an LLC, or something else, but you have to look at what your local regulations and requirements are licensing and regulations wise 1st. That being said, Do you have a business plan? If not then you need to create one. It is at the core of everything you do after. <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan"><u>https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan </u></a>Simple core things to the above also involve being able to answer questions like "how do i manage to convince people to buy in to the thing i am doing?" If its crypto or some other type of service what advantage can a partner, or buyer except to gain from their investment? The answer to this is complicated and not a "crypto money go brrr, buy now" type of a BS one, but one that relates directly to what the coin is supposed to do and be for. So its not just a matter of selling like hocking apples off a cart on some street corner, its about what you can do to gain trust from potential partners, customers, and asset holders. You will have a really hard time doing that if you don't have a solid product on your hands, and otherwise means to showcase its benefits over others for them to effectively gamble on.<ul>
        <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [09:50:05 PM EST February 6th, 2022]</strong>: And how do I set up this business? I am in California. What is an LLC? I'm not planning on taking money from people, I don't need to do it anymore. My product is <i>pretty</i> solid, I just need to set up the business to be able to sell it.<ul>
            <li><strong>[deleted] [11:17:24 PM EST February 6th, 2022]</strong>: In all fairness if you don't know what something as basic as what an LLC is you are not ready to run a business let alone something as complex and highly nuanced as a crypto related enterprise. Id take some business management, and economics classes at your community college to see what is what. They may even offer entrepreneurship related ones at that too. An LLC is a limited liability corporation and all. Not saying that to insult, belittle or anything, but that's such a fundamental level thing there is no way to get around it... would be like someone saying they want to get hired as a chemistry professor, and claiming to be prepared and knowledgeable, but not knowing what stoichiometry is, or how the periodic table of elements works.<ul>
                <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [08:58:41 PM EST February 8th, 2022]</strong>: Thank you for the advice, I'll see about enrolling in those classes.</li>

But you don't seem to understand cryptocurrency and nft. Become an expert on the generation of those two things and then come back and we can talk about sales and marketing.</li>

<h3>Difference between sole proprietorship and an LLC?</h3>
<p>[03:59:26 PM EST February 10th, 2022] [Oscar - CoSeamCreator] [r/smallbusiness]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I've been reading these business courses and read about these two terms, sole proprietorship and LLC, but I can't seem to notice the difference. Can someone break it down for me to understand?</p>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>cdjcon [04:05:48 PM February 10th, 2022]</strong>: USA: LLC is a limited liability entity and if you draw up the paperwork correctly, and follow the rules (separate bank account, annual meetings, etc.) you can shield your personal assets from legal risks. Sole proprietor has none of these features.<ul>
        <li><strong>minngeilo [12:45:35 AM February 11th, 2022]</strong>: As someone who couldn't distinguish the various resources online from being legit or not what is the correct way to do LLC?<ul>
            <li><strong>cdjcon [02:41:43 PM EST February 11th, 2022]</strong>: How important is having limited liability? If its not that important, go to your State's department of State online. Look around, maybe email someone. You should be able to find sample agreements, etc. If limited liability is super important, then a lawyer is essential. And that needs to be a real relationship, this person will be defending you if something goes wrong.<ul>
                <li><strong>cdbessig [12:44:35 PM EST February 11th, 2022]</strong>: Hire a lawyer. Don’t comingle bank accounts. Never sign something personally. Those are good places to start.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ezerhadden [05:50:56 PM EST February 10th, 2022]</strong>: Sole Proprietorship - if the business get sued or fined then you as the SP must pay out of business funds and if those are used up you then owe out of personal funds. LLC - do it correctly and your private funds are NOT liable for business issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>jmattsen93 [02:41:37 AM EST February 11th, 2022]</strong>: Why would anyone choose to be a sole proprietor instead of a LLC?</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Richard_Vall [08:59:29 AM EST February 11th, 2022]</strong>: It’s first of all related to liability. Shareholders are not liable for their companies. If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders lose their investments in the company but they don’t have to cover the company’s debts. If you are a self employed person, you are fully liable to your clients, partners, etc. You can find more at <a href="https://nomadized.work/freelancers-unlimited-liability-meaning-and-effective-methods-to-eliminate-it/"><u>https://nomadized.work/freelancers-unlimited-liability-meaning-and-effective-methods-to-eliminate-it/</u></a></li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CannotThinkOfANameee [01:39:00 AM EST February 12th, 2022]</strong>: In a sense you can think of in this way As a sole trader, YOU are the business. The business cannot function without you (this is also why it’s very difficult to sell a sole proprietorship business before it’s converted to an LLC) As a sole proprietor, your assets aren’t seperate from your business whereas in an LLC they are. This means that you’re responsible for any business debt you may incur.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gibscreen [07:06:07 PM EST February 10th, 2022]</strong>: Just Google it. Plenty of websites explain all the differences.</li>

<h3>What are the best ways to advertise a company?</h3>

    <li><strong>MortgagesON [08:06:05 PM EST February 18th, 2022]</strong>: Depends on what kind of company, who you’re selling to, and where those people are. Care to share some further info and maybe we can point you in the right direction?<ul>
        <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [08:19:32 PM EST February 18th, 2022]</strong>: I'm selling my own cryptocurrency, I'm selling to anyone interested in buying, and I'm in the United States of America so I would like to get people from here.

            <li><strong>MortgagesON [08:20:21 PM EST February 18th, 2022]</strong>: Most platforms won’t allow that. Crypto is forbidden as an actual ad category on Google and FB/Instagram and I can assume TikTok.

  <p>Hi Oscar 😊 I just posted one of my stories to Reddit like you said I should!! Its one you've read before but you can still read it again if you want 😅! I've been sooo busy at the library lately I havent had time to write a lot! Can you tell Nolan I say hi? 🥰🥰 Maybe if he comes back to visit again then Felix will cheer up.

All the people here are nice, I've been having many interactions and was well received so I hope you get the same treatment. Hope the library job is going fine, I've been working on my own company and I think I'm almost ready to launch it. I'll tell Nolan when we meet for lunch one of these days, but you can tell him through here, his name us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/No_Rain_3691/"><u>u/No_Rain_3691</u></a>.

  <p>Bad news.</p>
  <p>Felix reacted poorly and left a comment on my post saying it's time we go home, I'm worried he's done something that could jeopardize our lives here. I expected him to want to go home but I didn't think he would try to take us with him... I'm not sure what he's planning, so to be safe I'm using the contingency plan from this morning. We'll need to find a way to communicate with Caria and Zoey without alerting Felix... this is going to be tough. I'm worried Felix might've already given up their address to these Academy people. We need to get Zoey somewhere safe as soon as possible though, since he knows her location. Can one of you contact her and instruct her to go to a hotel? I'll find a place near her and pay for her travel there, she just needs to stay safe. Do not contact Felix until we know what his goals are. (ROT13)</p>

She brought up a good point that we have no idea what this academy is doing here to begin with. Who knows how the plane has changed in 7 years? I know Felix was desperate for a way back, but I really don't think he should trust this "UMAD" even if they are from our home plane. I wish I could help him but I know he wouldn't listen to us.

Maybe we can convince him to stay here with us 😥<ul>
                        <li><strong>Crypt0K41 [12:23:19 AM EST February 25th, 2022]</strong>: last time we had a talk about that was before we all moved across the country and u know how that went. im glad you are safe tho, its getting late so we will talk tomorrow. maybe you could write one of your stories to distract yourself and also cheer us up.</li>

We think Felix told them about us and he's trying to drag us back with him. I suggest you to block him from here and cease any communication with him. We'll tell you more when we are safe. If Felix knows your address then you have to move out, take Socius with you to keep her safe.</p>

What's his name here? I'll block him. I don't think they would let Socius back home, if she can't come then I won't go either.<ul>

    <li><strong>No_Rain_3691 [03:11:02 PM EST]</strong>: I’m a big fan of this new Nico character, haha! Very well written, Zoey!</li>
    <li><strong>FantasyFanatic_887 [11:27:08 PM EST February 27th, 2022]: </strong>I like how this seems like a reversion of common isekai tropes, everyone knows how they'd act if they moved from our world to some fantasy world with magic. The idea of having people move from a medieval world to our world, now that's real confusion which makes the story very satisfying! I'm look forward to see how the protagonists develop in our world. Excellent!<ul>
        <li>Wild_Personality_158 [10:57:28 AM EST February 28th, 2022]: Thank you 😊😊🥰!! I do have a question what is isekai 🤔🤔?<ul>
            <li>FantasyFanatic_887 [11:40:16 EST February 28th, 2022]: Isekai is a type of story followed by some Japanese cartoons. Typically it involves someone from our world being summoned to another fantasy world with magic and stuff where they have to undertake some epic quest, like defeating a demon king or villain. It’s pretty popular!<ul>
                <li>Wild_Personality_158 [12:10:16 PM EST February 28th, 2022]: Ohhh that’s just like my story 😄😄!! Thank you for explaining 😊<ul>

  <p>u/No_Rain_3691 during breakfast oscar showed me emails about what he calls an investor that is willing to put an eight digit amount of money on his shitcoin. the guy isnt even from here so they are meeting on friday at the riverside plaza, its super sus. i would point out some spelling mistakes but to be fair zoey is no better, but this guy is super sus. tell oscar hes an idiot and shouldnt go, he wont listen to me¡¡¡¡¡ (ROT13)</p>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No_Rain_3691 [02:06:50 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: Oscar did what??? Good thing you caught me on my break! Not to undermine Coseam, but with regard to recent events I don't think we should trust anybody trying to arrange a physical meeting… u/CoseamCreator, I'm sorry Oscar, but it just isn't safe enough right now to meet up with strangers. Doesn't your business rely on virtual transactions anyway? If someone isn't willing to follow your business model, they're probably not worth the hassle of a meeting. You should only do business with people who trust you and your product. I know your business means a lot to you and I'm glad that somebody is interested, but please don't go to this meeting right now. I care about you all, and I just don't think this seems safe from what Kai has said. (ROT13)<ul>
        <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [02:15:14 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: First of all, it's CoSeam with a capital S. Businesses rely on trust and these types of investments require to meet to build that trust. It's just a meeting with an investor I don't see what the issue is, and they sounded legitimate. I don't see what the issue is, and to be honest it sounds more like you two are jealous of me becoming successful. (ROT13)<ul>
            <li><strong>Crypt0K41 [02:21:36 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: bro with all due respect, ur business sucks ass. u have literally 0 karma, worse yet now u have -1 karma because i downvoted u. but for real, this is sus man i dont think anyone out of nowhere would invest so much money on a coin that is new. do u even know who that guy is¿¿¿ (ROT13)<ul>
                <li><strong>No_Rain_3691 [02:27:58 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: Oscar, I apologize for misspelling the name of CoSeam! I am in a rush because my break ends in a few minutes. I disagree with Kai's opinions about your business but I do agree that this person seems suspicious. Do you know who they are? How do you know they're a legitimate investor? You should request some form of proof or identity from them, or evidence they have the money to invest that they claim to. Why do you have to meet them in person? (ROT13)<ul>
                    <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [02:36:09 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: You are forgiven. This person is just an investor, a willful investor that approached me for business. They... didn't provide any identification and their name looked like something Kai would use. I guess I can ask for that but I believe they are legitimate, they sounded professional. (ROT13)<ul>
                        <li><strong>Crypt0K41 [02:40:26 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: thats like the first thing u had to do. u have to verify u are not getting scammed, or worse yet if someone is after us getting scammed is the least of ur concerns. email them asking for something to legitimate them (ROT13)<ul>
                            <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [04:19:17 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: I just heard back from the investor and they provided a list of what they invested in and I think they are pretty reliable. They also use high technical language so it's clear they know much about it. I think they are legitimate, but I'm sure they probably felt hurt from me sending the email. If this fails I'm blaming you two. (ROT13)<ul>
                                <li><strong>Crypt0K41 [04:26:28 PM EST February 2nd, 2022]</strong>: i dont know they still sound sus to me. u could be fooled by the words they use. id say cancel the meeting its not worth the risk. if u are not good with my opinion wait for nolans once hes out of work (ROT13)<ul>
                                    <li><strong>No_Rain_3691 [10:38:18 PM EST March 2nd, 2022]</strong>: I agree. I think the safest option is to cancel the meeting. They may sound knowledgeable, but I'm sure anybody could lie with enough research. Did they show you any evidence of money or evidence of their investments? I still think you shouldn't believe them without physical proof. (ROT13)</li>
                                    <li><strong>CoSeamCreator [11:03:42 PM EST March 2nd, 2022]</strong>: The physical proof he would give me at the meeting. But fine, I won't go so you all stop being so harsh on me. I'll look for easier and smaller investors in the future... I guess. (ROT13)</li>
