<p><i>"Long ago the great eight, those of the beginning, permitted all things that are. There was stagnation however, a stalemate in progress. Frik gave part of themself to the world, making them inferior but also providing the will that wills itself. When this happened Roht and his new will killed the old god of war. Lay'Ora disagreed with the separation of the divine but Belthid shrank the world. No god in their total self might fit in this place. Lay'Ora in her disagreement attempted to occupy the Material. People during this time realized consequence and soon much was necessitated. It was for this reason that she was sent away elsewhere. Thus Anankaia "That which was necessitated" came into being. It was grief and the want to be punished by mortals that forced a reshaping of things."</i> ~Blaise</p>

      <li>“...most popular denomination within North Belthas has a rather elaborate holy symbol but for practitioners it can be simplified.&nbsp; Let me try to describe it. Start with a circle and then on the lower portion have a semi-circle occupy the bottom. The apex of the semi circle should be the center of the circle. It almost looks like a partial eclipse. Then from the center extend two lines outwards evenly in a V shape." - Blaise</li>
