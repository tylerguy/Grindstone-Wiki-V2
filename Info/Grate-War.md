## How it started

The Grate War (probably) began when Rose off-handley mention grilled cheese in their list of things others were talking about, among ethics and philosophy. This lead to a discussion of the ethics on grilling cheese (“Not vegan probably.” - Name) and many cheese related puns. (Puns contributed by Dowan and Loreline.)

The next day, a user by the name of The Cheese God joined the server. Those online at the time immediately started praising Them, as well as asking the Cheese Pope and Rose (Cheesemother) if this was their true god. Those that worshipped Them quickly accepted Them as the True God and started enacting cheese-related shenanigans.

These shenanigans included spreading Cheese God propaganda. The Author was not online at the time of Them appearing and cannot give a detailed explanation of all the cheese-related shenanigans.

## A change in Rules

However, on August 15th, the rules of the server were added, including talks of Them and cheese discourse being secluded to the #general-lounge and #without-voice. This rule was generally accepted, except for when They briefly appeared to ask department representatives (Or perhaps just the Planar Department Head, Genevieve Zuchterin) their opinion on cheese. UMAD Management seemed to accept these minor infractions as they were the only cheese-related topics to escape into the greater whole of the server.

## Cheese Satan joins the server

The next day, things got out-of-hand. The true war began when a user by name of Cheese Satan [They/Them] joined the server, and started spreading Anti-Cheese propaganda. They aimed to kill Cheese God.

A minor argument occurred, wherein Cheese Satan and God argued over Cheese God’s divinity, and whether the server was over the cheese.

Cheese Satan gained their first (vocal) follower by name of A Very Ninja UwUkulele and named them their pope. A Very Anti-Cheese Pope then joined the argument and decided cheese legally couldn’t have rights due to it being non-sentient and also food. 


## Another change in Rules

Rose proclaimed her regret in starting the cheese cult and requested the madness to be stopped.

Her wish had been granted when UMAD Management appeared to inform us there had been an update to the rules. This update was as follows:

“11. Due to continued complaints religious cheese discourse is no longer permitted except for the purpose of explaining it’s origin to curious new applicants. You will be given one warning.”

Most others obeyed this rule immediately and cut ties with Cheese Satan and Cheese God, however They continued the cheese related discourse and were given their one warning for it. A few minutes later, UMAD Management went through on their threat and banned Cheese God from the Project: Grindstone discord server.

Thus, the Grate War came to a (temporary) end, with Cheese Satan saying “I- I won.” 

It is assumed that The Grate War is still continuing, however, as a separate discord server was created with the purpose of continuing it without bothering the applicants and staff of Project: Grindstone unless they wish it.
