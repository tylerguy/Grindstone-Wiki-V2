## Transcript
*From November 19th, 2021*
### Blaise on Post-Applicant Onboarding
I would like to start with thanking everyone for their participation in the application process.  Now that the dust has settled from processing it is time to move onto new things.  Every person was evaluated on several key qualities from character, to interest, to accuracy and speed of performance.  We also conducted character evaluations as many of you know.  These evaluations were not limited to the Peach experiment but also included your entire experience here.  For some of you we had to reach further to understand you and where you might fit within our organization.  Every department requires labor and some of you are part of the ART.  With that known it is also important we maintain some employees who do not transfer and there will be opportunities to become Specialist Employees.  It is my hope that by the end of this you understand that each and every one of you are valuable for the operations here at the Universal Magical Academy at Dial.  It is also my hope that you understand your duties, clearance, interdepartmental interactions, and many other things.

I will start by covering some basics.  Some of you may already know this information but it is important to be repeated and accessible to everyone.

Within UMAD there are six departments dedicated to research.  The largest on campus being Cultural Studies.  We exist as an extension of the Belthean government but also simultaneously distributors of information and a research institution.  Each of you have been assigned to your department for several reasons.  You will notice that you all now have an internal chat for your department, this will be important for your collaboration.  Within each department are 3 grades of employees, specialist employees, research assistants of two grades, researchers, and those researchers with field permission.  Some of you found your way here through invitation from Field Researchers to explore a classified project, Project Grindstone.  Unfortunately you were not permitted information on Project Grindstone as you were not official members of UMAD and even still the project remains Need To Know.  The project does require assistance from additional Field Researchers however and that is why we at UMAD have begun utilizing the Accelerated Researcher Track.  We are looking for members of the plane designated EXT-918, your world, to assist as field researchers but also establish external operations on your plane.

In order to conduct your work you will work with your research department on and off plane including an intermediary that will assist in communication and assign work.  This intermediary has lived on EXT-918 for over a year and a half.  They are accessible by voice chat, DM, on the discord itself, and are more familiar with your customs and culture.  They are here to help you.  During onboarding you will be introduced to your team's intermediary.  Each of them are field researchers and experts in their field with a temporary exception to the Planar Studies department.  You have our apologies but your intermediary had to return to PM-1 to deal with a personal matter.  Alongside your own department you will be working interdepartmentally with other research departments but also non-research departments.

I myself, Blaise, work in Infernal Affairs and we assist in the distribution of information and some operations.  There are other departments such as Accounting who audits all UMAD resources or potential resources to assist with cost benefit analysis of any and all actions a supervisor may be attempting to make as well as determine billable offenses.

You are in a unique situation.  Due to the enormous cost of training with the ART much of your earning will be put back into the training itself or an escrow off plane.  Due to international laws and the limitations of our presence on your plane this also means that we won't be able to directly bill you especially since al accounts can only be billable in our currency due to a classified and necessary phenomenon that is an unintended consequence of a previous research experiment.

That does not mean that the waste of UMAD resources does not have consequences and I will remind you we are all working together for a brighter and more transparent future between our planes and nations.  We hope to learn much from you and with your new clearance levels we hope to teach you much in return.  This brings me to clearance levels, their purpose, and reference.

All personnel have established clearance levels from 1-15.  Applicants have the lowest clearance levels.  Some materials in your projects will be Need To Know for your project meaning that personnel who need to know will be informed.  Higher Clearance levels assume that you have the competency and trust of the organization to recognize when you might Need To Know something when otherwise it would be restricted to you.  This means you can be informed on project information that you would not normally be part of.  The higher your clearance the more access you have.  In addition to this you will have access to reference materials.  We are slowly updating ways for you to access these materials but until then you will need to fill out the appropriate reference request documents.  Many documents will be accessible to you and through updates on the discord you will have access to a number of new files as onboarding continues and we are able to create our updates.

Reference is located in the basement of UMAD campus and both Infernal Affairs as well as Accounting have additional offices there.  During onboarding the appropriate contacts will be given to you to make a reference request.

We recognize you are not experts in your field yet, in fact far from it.  That is fine, we are attempting to foster trust and new skills while aggressively teaching your specialty.  Within your department are experts but even beyond that there are specialties and sub-specialties within each department such as Alchemy's Iatrochemistry.  You can learn various skills and subject while on your way to better understanding Toristic process and conducting your research or interdepartmental tasks.  Ask questions, you'll find many are no longer restricted to you and there is much to learn.  This leads me to the different duties required of you by position and how we intend to compensate and encourage productivity.

Employees of Grade 1 and Grade 2 will have more restricted access to information due to security than employees of Grade 3.  Employees of Grade 3 may transfer into the ART at certain qualifying times or may be provided promotion as a Specialist Employee.  At the time of promotion your new responsibilities will be explained to you.  Those of the ART will be further tested.  While even the employees will be under constant review ART members will be given additional attention.  Assignments are opportunities to stand out so work hard as your intermediary and even other members of your team might be reporting on you.  ART members will also learn their specialty and assist researchers in their work by submitting new work in various tasks.  Sometimes this means interdepartmental work as well.  This is true of research assistants but sometimes team or All Department Missions may be assigned.  You should be familiar with the flow of such missions through your time in admissions but these aren't tests, they are necessary assignments for our success.  These require the assistance of employees and ART.  Lastly should you find yourself a Researcher, depending on your performance in your specialty you might be able to request resources to conduct your own research.  All assignments, missions, and performance will be used for purposes of Departmental Points of Commendation.

The DPC program was developed and utilized once before within UMAD to encourage performance through competition.  I should remind you that all departments work towards a common goal and we are all on the same team at the end of each interval.  Each department however will have a top five leaderboard for DPC and each department their own DPC scores.  These scores will be public and are indicative of the performance of each department.  This assists us in determining compensation by goods and services.  Special permissions, objects such as four points and unique materials, first consideration for research resources, and even chances to meet some researchers or staff may be utilized as incentive for top performing departments or members.  All rewards are not public at this time.

Lectures will continue but under a new format which is to be determined.  The lecturers may be guests or the intermediaries from your department.  Remember to ask plenty of questions to the intermediaries.

Before your clearance level becomes active you will be given a document solidifying your opportunity with UMAD.  Onboarding will continue through the 24th and after you will have access to even more resources including a UMAD campus webpage where you will also be given newsletters from each department.  If there is however anything you need to make your time working with UMAD a better experience please let us know.  Also, remember that your application process may be finished but it is not for everyone.  For expedient processing a department member can refer an applicant and they will matriculate quickly but as an employee grade 1 or 2.  Otherwise they will go through an application process that will be greatly changed for new applicants.  More members of your department will only assist in gaining DPC and all new members recruited will be rewarded with DPC.

Departmental transfers are possible but very difficult.  You can speak with your intermediary about this should it be necessary.

I'd like to conclude this with encouraging you to reach out and ask questions to myself or your intermediary.  I'd also like to thank you for this time and opportunity.  I was initially assigned here to act as a community organizer on top of my other work functions until this date, the 19th of November, in order to guide the first wave of recruits through admissions.  Thank you all again for all your hard work and the wonderful nature of the community as it has been both educational and a wonderful experience for myself.  The nature of my work at this time must change however as work continues but the task changes.

I have confirmation at this time to share with you my new position within UMAD.  I'm being provided special clearance and universal EXT-918 access as community coordinator and manager for multiple groups and functions.  I now have permission to be public in some places including conventions, expos, and concerts to engage with your people.  I will also remain here but my temporary primary function is the intermediary for the Planar Studies Department.
