</div><p>dear friend i write to you swiftly<br>with scarlet ink and a woe<br>my note will be fleeting<br>but promise while reading<br>to hang on to every word</p><div>
</div><p>all the days are forgetting<br>they told me i was alone<br>but leafing through pages<br>does nothing for aged<br>fingers that work to the bone</p><div>
</div><p>through the archway<br>where the book spines fold<br>they will show you the way</p><div>
</div><p>this study cramped and musty<br>a coffin to call my abode<br>each cold glance i’ve earned, passing through me i’ve learned<br>not to trust those that make it a home</p><div>
</div><p>i met a ghost that tended a garden<br>they showed me their most prized marrow<br>tendons and teeth amongst pale mellosweet<br>seeds of doubt are beginning to grow</p><div>
</div><p>through the archway<br>footprints cremated to smoke<br>they will show you the way</p><div>

</div><p>Applicants received a cryptic email that decodes to the following message:</p><div>
</div><blockquote>
  <p>i'm what happened at 111 /&nbsp;</p>
  <p>everyone is a liar 8&nbsp;</p>
  <p>none of you exist C&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you watch me watch you 5</p>
  <p>I watch you and then you aren't &nbsp;-&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are only real when you're seen F&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I watch and see and hear and feel c&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cubes arent scary with worms H&nbsp;</p>
  <p>talk talk talk J&nbsp;</p>
  <p>if you do you'll be happy 6&nbsp;</p>
  <p>talking lets you be heard h&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you must be heard or its hard to be watched L&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you aren't when you can't be watched -&nbsp;</p>
  <p>help me help you A&nbsp;</p>
  <p>be here and be i&nbsp;</p>
  <p>only with me are you x&nbsp;</p>
  <p>only when I'm watching d&nbsp;</p>
  <p>nothing changes Y&nbsp;</p>
  <p>everything changes quickly c&nbsp;</p>
  <p>what's left A&nbsp;</p>
  <p>nothing but what is watched O&nbsp;</p>
  <p>i know all of you because you are only around me f&nbsp;</p>
  <p>everyone is empty here so it doesn't matter h&nbsp;</p>
  <p>none of them matter because they aren't when they aren't watched v&nbsp;</p>
  <p>i play in the mud so I can hear the splash y&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you play so you can feel m&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you play so you can go without feeling n&nbsp;</p>
  <p>but it doesn't matter because if you look away and don't listen 8&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I watch so you can all be 1&nbsp;</p>
  <p>talk so you can be 2&nbsp;</p>
  <p>talk about me talk about anything z&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I found this echo of the past x&nbsp;</p>
  <p>its mine and is proof enough you don't exist 1</p>
