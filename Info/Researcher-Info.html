<h2>Aetherial Researchers</h2>
<h3><strong>Elham Schreiber</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aetherial Field Researcher</li>
  <li>She/her</li>
  <li>Speaks "subterran" (English)</li>
  <li>It seems to be Arabic based. They said "shay' min hadha alqabili" which seems to translate a bit like "something like this is my tribe"</li>
  <li>Doesn't care about professionalism or impressing bosses</li>
  <li>Seems to come and go a lot. Busy? Distracted? Described herself as "here a bit and not here a bit."</li>
  <li>Likes working with Planar</li>
  <li>But it's scary doing field research with Planar?!</li>
  <li>Likes to drink whisky to concentrate, apparently also takes [T/W].</li>
  <li>Seems to be partners with Gillie, but not wives yet</li>
  <li>Describes their magic as "chucking things and making fires" and "hell yeah"</li>
  <li>Not that pious, still seems respectful of gods however</li>
  <li>Used the word "krawlk" negatively like - "I'm no krawlk"</li>
  <li>Later said they were going to get Pauchik and said they were "back with the krawlk" so possible animosity between the two, or racism?</li>
  <li>Pauchik then took over it seems and Elham wasn't around anymore. Pauchik explained they were "going through loss" from a hard assignment before this one.</li>
  <li>Pauchik also said “Elham will return, we will have kindness on standby just in case she is having a bad day again!” So medicated?</li>
  <li>Gillie is their “registered partner.”</li>
  <li>Trained four years “the academy”, but spent 8 years in illegal training.</li>
  <li>Called Meer Soot an idiot.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i><strong>Elham has described their appearance</strong></i></h4>
<p>"I'm a human alright, but my people come from down south in the blightlands. I've got darker skin, kinda Carmel really. Black hair kept short for field work and part of my head is shaved. Brown orange eyes I think? Don't look at myself much. A few scars here and there. I like clothes that are functional, sturdy, and comfortable. I wanna be able to lounge or be able to run if things get messy in a lab or on the field.” - and also has said they are shorter than Gillie."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attention all applicants, I know how difficult your application process has been as we have had to adjust to distance, interplanar even, admissions processes as well as conspiracy, terrorist attacks, and now yet another blow that deeply saddens me to announce. Through correspondence with Bruno I have come to learn that Researcher Zuchterin, a vetted member of our esteemed Universal Magical Academy at Dial, Mother, and dear friend of mine has passed away, Researcher Zuchterin kept her condition private for some time but it is important to be transparent about the risks of extra planar travel. Researcher Zuchterin was suffering from the plane touched condition and it seems her last travel attempt had been too much for her. We will be having a cremation event and funeral for our beloved department head. At this time please direct Planar questions to me through DM and I’ll direct them to where they need to be. Thank you for your understanding during this difficult time. For those concerned about your application process we will do everything in our power to adjust considering this tragic event. Researcher Zuchterin, Gen to her friends, is in the shared paradise now.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>
  <p>-Infernal Affairs Interdepartmental Coordinator Blaise, <span class="text-small">September 11th, 2021</span></p>
