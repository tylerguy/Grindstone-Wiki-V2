# *a letter from a notable source* - a song written by Beetlebug

This article is about the song discovered by Applicants and the official release of the song on YouTube by Beetlebug.

## Lyrics

dear friend i write to you swiftly  
with scarlet ink and a woe  
my note will be fleeting  
but promise while reading  
to hang on to every word

all the days are forgetting  
they told me i was alone  
but leafing through pages  
does nothing for aged  
fingers that work to the bone

through the archway  
where the book spines fold  
they will show you the way

this study cramped and musty  
a coffin to call my abode  
each cold glance i’ve earned, passing through me i’ve learned  
not to trust those that make it a home

i met a ghost that tended a garden  
they showed me their most prized marrow  
tendons and teeth amongst pale mellosweet  
seeds of doubt are beginning to grow

through the archway  
footprints cremated to smoke  
they will show you the way
