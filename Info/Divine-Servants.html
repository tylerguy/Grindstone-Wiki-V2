<h1>Hermenengild</h1>
<p>Hermenengild (AKA @Nessy's Bestie#2340) is a devil and servant of the god <strong>Anankaia</strong>. Summoned on the Minecraft server to "make deals with a devil<sup>1</sup>," they later joined the Discord server and were given the role High Clearance Guest<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Their Discord username, “<i>Nessy's Bestie</i>,” derives from a nickname given to Anankaia/"That Which Was Necessitated."</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hermenengild:&nbsp;<br><strong>That Which Was Necessitated</strong>. Nessy, for short, to some. Not that I'd recommend you doing so.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>On a Minecraft adventure taking place on November 5/6th 2021, adventurers were tasked with seeking the help of servants of the gods Qoseem and Anankaia.&nbsp;<br><br>Adventurers built a maxed-out gold beacon near Absencetice, and once lit the ground changed to netherrack. Blaise informed players they should make a deal Hermenengild, a servant of the god Anankaia. However, those who had completed the application process were prohibited from making such deals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several players made deals with Hermenengild, the details of which have been kept private, and shortly thereafter a temple to Anankaia was constructed in place of the beacon. Hermenengild created a statue depicting themselves facing the temple.</p>

<p>Upon the base of the statue, Hermenengild inscribed a message using Crimson Signs and Glow Squid Ink. When read together, the message is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Silly young child didn't you know? Hell is this flesh where they seal up your soul...</p>
  <p>A god's not forgiving, a devil's not cruel. What sort of craftsman would reward their tool[?]</p>
  <p>Silly young child were you never warned? Angels and devils have halo, nor horns.</p>
  <p>We serve some small purpose, no less and no more. Why spit on that blessing and beg for a war?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>:)</p>

<p>In front of the statue, players may use a lectern holding the <i>Book of Petitions</i> propose deals to Hermenengild when he is not available to communicate with directly.</p>

<h2>Current Residence</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hermenengild:<br>Recently I had been given permission by my Duke to serve as the liaison for the affairs of the <strong>Infernal Consequence<sup>3</sup></strong> on what you all are calling <a href="/Info/EXT-111">EXT-111</a>. So my home would be there for the time being, I suppose. And before that, the Infernal Consequence.<br>I've made trips to the Material long, long ago... but mostly, I have underlings handle that sort of thing for me at this point when one of your kind feels a need to summon a devil for whatever reason.<br>I've recently been permitte<i>d [access to the Grindstone Discord server] </i>as well, however, thanks to a very kind sponsorship.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Rank</h2>
<p>Hermenengild is a <i>holder</i>, a title or rank bestowed upon Divine Servants by the God they serve under.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hermenengild:</p>
  <p>I am [a holder], yes. It is a wonderful thing to be. An honor that cannot be put into words.</p>
  <p>The usefulness is inconsequential. It is holy and good that I am so blessed. But in all practicality, I'd rather have [Anankaia's] favour than their ire.</p>
  <p>It's a position of authority, and respect. A blessing bestowed upon certain valued divine likenesses, who have earned the favor of That Which Was Necessitated.</p>
  <p>All divine servants are angels, but only certain ones are <strong>called </strong>angels directly. There are the angels of the Shared Paradise. There are the devils of the Infernal Consequence. There are the fae of Oberon. There are the harvestmen of Qoseem.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>In the EXT-111 plane, Hermenengild's appearance seems to mimic his chosen Discord profile photo, depicting a Tiefling<sup>4</sup> with stained glass adornments.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hermenengild appears to take great interest in the UMAD applicants, despite relatively disliking the UMAD institution.<sup>[Source Needed]</sup> In their introduction to the Discord server, they introduced themselves with the following.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You may call me Hermenengild. I am a regular person of average size and hobbies. There's nothing that special about me, but lots special about you all. Let's be friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hermenengild makes frequent jokes and often inquires into aspects of human culture that they are unfamiliar with. They are very helpful, often aiding players with tasks in the Minecraft server and creating entertaining scenarios for players to participate in. They enjoy being complimented, sometimes requesting compliments and rewarding players who provide them.&nbsp;Hermenengild answers most questions openly, sharing a wealth of information freely, and takes great offense to being referenced incorrectly as a Demon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hermenengild enjoys several hobbies, such as Poetry, Architecture, Stargazing, and Gardening.<sup>5</sup> They also appear to enjoy music and singing, stating their favorite types of music to be Opera and Musicals and expressing distaste for dubstep. Hermenengild expressed brief interest in singing for players on a voice call<sup>6</sup>, however seemed concerned about whether or not humans would be able to physically hear their voice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They appear to enjoy recommending music to players, having sent several links to songs on YouTube they enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to songs, Hermenengild has shared with applicants a poem they wrote about the Infernal Consequence.<sup>7</sup></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Little crows' feet leave their tracks through the ashes&nbsp;<br>Marking their dance upon what remains of love&nbsp;<br>As the wind blows it sweeps away the cinders&nbsp;<br>Ashes and embers form the stars above&nbsp;<br><br>Little crows' feet curl upon the bones who perished&nbsp;<br>Raking their talons on remnants of the scorned&nbsp;<br>Tears of those passing well within the chalice&nbsp;<br>Drink up their birthright of those gone to mourn&nbsp;<br><br>Death and derision are the midwives to our future&nbsp;<br>Little crows' feet march us to perdition&nbsp;<br>And the hells, they are numbered equal to the stars&nbsp;<br>One for each step of each little crows' feet</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><sup>1 </sup>Demons and Devils are different. Devils must fulfill the deals they make, while Demons do not. Devils consider themselves superior beings to Demons, and take offense to being identified incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><sup>2 </sup>A High Clearance Guest appears to be a guest within the Discord who is otherwise lacking a formal title within UMAD.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> The Infernal Consequence can be compared to our plane's understanding of Hell, as per <a href="https://discord.com/channels/860257333246165034/860257334249259020/906666439618990120">Blaise</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/860257333246165034/860257334249259020/908652806636974110">Hermenengild's</a> explanations.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiefling">Tiefling</a> is “a fictional humanoid race in the <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> fantasy roleplaying game. Originally introduced in <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>, they became one of the primary races available for player characters in the fourth edition of the game. Tieflings were usually descended from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiend_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">fiends</a> but not the same manner as half-fiends, since a Tiefling's fiendish ancestry lies further up the family tree.”&nbsp;</p>
