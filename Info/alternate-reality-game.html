<h1 style="text-align:center;">Beginner's Guide: ARGs</h1>
<p>You’ve stumbled across Project Grindstone and noticed it’s being called an ARG. What’s an ARG? How can I play? <i>What is reality, and what makes it alternate?!</i> &nbsp;Not to worry, we’re here to help! To be safe, let’s start with the basics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - This is a very basic explanation of ARGs. No two ARGs are alike, and what may be true to Project Grindstone, may not be true for another.<br><br><a href="https://forms.gle/k8Ve991UcfbzBrPr9">ARG Survey</a><br>Totally optional, simply to gauge knowledge of Alternate Reality Games!&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What's an ARG?</h1>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">Wikipedia</a>, an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) is defined as "an interactive networked narrative that uses the real world as a platform and employs transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For newcomers, the definition can lead to more questions than answers. To make it as simple as possible; an ARG is a story that is told across multiple platforms, uses the real world as setting and the narrative may be altered by players.</p>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>The game part of an ARG comes from the use of puzzles and advancements in the narrative or information being locked behind a gate of sorts.</p>
<p>Typically, codes and ciphers are used as tools to create a barrier for players to work through and are then rewarded with important content. The content could include story details, information necessary to fill a plot hole or even a new platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Similar to a checkpoint during a video game, you can’t progress until you solve or complete the task.</p>
<p>Text encryption isn't the only form of puzzle, though the most common. Another barrier between you and information, and most of what makes up Project Grindstone is character interaction. Conversation with in-universe people, even casually, could open a treasure trove of information. It's usually not helpful to antagonize or try to bully the information out, situation depending, but rather become friends with them! Ask them questions, get to know who they are as well as their universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, no two ARGs are the same, including characters. The only way of testing what works and what doesn't is to try. The good news is, there isn’t a right or wrong way to play, all that we ask is you enjoy yourself!</p>
<h3>Other Encryption Methods</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> - messages hidden within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message. Usually images,&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">Spectrogram</a> - messages hidden in sound, found through the visual representation of frequencies of the audio.</p>
<h3>Common Deciphering Tools</h3>
<h4>Codes &amp; Ciphers</h4>

<h2>Is an ARG real?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>No, ARGs are fiction so they aren't real, though it's never said. Your job is to pretend or act like it is for immersion, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspension of disbelief is to purposefully avoid using logic when examining parts of an ARG that seem impossible in our reality, including supernatural and fantastic elements.</p>
