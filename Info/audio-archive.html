  <p><i>Yes</i> it's <i>fine</i>. It's fine.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Thank you. [clears throat]&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Attention applicants of the Universal Magical Academy at Dial. This is Janet speaking. As you may have noticed, your application process has been lengthy. This is due to a couple of reasons. First, we are dealing with the complication of adjusting our application process to account for your world, and the inability to conduct this process in person. Secondly, it has come to our attention that a number of you have been in contact with an individual who intends to undermine UMAD's authority, and has adversely effected the application experience for you. Those working with this individual are the direct cause of our delays. Providing information to who this person is, or those involved, will be properly rewarded. Please know that the entity Peach is dangerous and has attempted an attack on our facilities. The attack has been promptly thwarted, and it should be noted that given our resources, UMAD remains a safe and stable working environment. This individual has only caused expense, and has not directly harmed anyone at this time. Thank you for your cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Is that good? Are we done?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fantastic.</p>

  <p>To the latest group of Applicants to the Universal Magical Academy of Dial, I'd just like to say congratulations for those of you who have already been accepted and good work to all of those who are still working through admissions. I know that this time has been difficult for many of you, in many ways. The tests can be daunting and the lectures somewhat dull and dense. But I promise it's all worth it in the end. You are all on a path that not many have the opportunity to take. You have a chance join the ranks of UMAD and work alongside Researchers like myself, to unravel the mysteries of not just our world and plane but many, many others. The work can be dangerous and difficult, and it is for that reason that we must all undergo such rigorous testing in order to gauge how well equipped we are to the task. The safety of not just yourself but those around you could very well depend on what you know and how you're able to handle yourself under the pressure. Some of you have already shown you are prepared enough to begin your duties as Research Assistants through careful examination of your knowledge and your character. Others who have not had the chance to undergo such exhaustive consideration will be beginning as Employees within UMAD. With the chance to become promoted to Research Assistants in the future. Please, do not consider this a penalty or an indication that you are somehow lacking something essential. I myself began my career within UMAD as an employee, and I do not consider it a source of shame. I've made a good home for myself here, with plenty of friends among my colleagues. And over the years I've risen steadily through the ranks to become a Research Assistant as well. At present I am even under consideration for promotion to Researcher. Your works will be rewarded and the struggles so far will not have been in vain. I look forward to our time together. Thank you.</p>
