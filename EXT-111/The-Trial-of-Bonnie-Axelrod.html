<h1>General Info</h1>
<p>March 23: posted on Discord Channel Administrative Announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is my duty to keep you informed on the events that took place on EXT-111. We have observed the various experiments as discovered by the applications and personnel in collaboration with the individual Henry Roth and deemed them to be a severe mismanagement of Universal Magic Academy at Dial resources. Following an internal investigation Culture Researcher Bonnie Axelrod was apprehended, due to the nature and experience of Project Grindstone with the case it has been deemed that a public trial within the server should decide the suspects guilt. The Trial shall begin at Samstag, 26. März 2022 22:00. You all invited to participate in the trial.</p>

  <p>I'd like to welcome everyone to the trial of Bonnie Axelrod which will be taking place in Courtroom, it will begin once everyone is present. Information about how the court system works, along with what any witness statements/evidence will be given to you during the proceedings.

<h1>Trial -Part 1</h1>
<h2>Chair of the presider</h2>
<p>Posted by the Assistant-Headmaster on 22/03/26</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Due to the circumstances of this case your community manager will not be the Presider of the case. I will instead be here to do as such. I am the Assistant Headmaster of the Universal Magical Academy at Dial and Project Lead for Project Grindstone.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:08<i>] </i>For those unfamiliar with how a Military Belthean court case is handled please see the following:</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:09<i>] </i>1. Judge enters, states charges and gives opening statement of definitive facts 2. Prosecution and Defence enter, charges are restated and a plea is submitted. 3. Prosecution and Defence each give opening statements respectively 4. Prosecution evidence is submitted with claim followed by Defence evidence 5. Expert Witnesses testify and verify evidence 6. Character Witnesses and Witnesses of action testify 7. Lower Court open to ask questions 8. Judge giving final warning before moving on. 9. Recess before Lower Court Votes 10. Sentencing following the vote</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:10<i>] </i>Many of you will represent the lower court for this case. While I unfortunately lack the ability to communicate verbally the Defense and the Prosecution will be speaking on a voice chat. Please note that the terms above are in EXT-918 language. I would in this case be the Judge.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:11<i>] </i>I will allow 4 more minutes before we begin.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:15<i>] </i>We will begin.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:16<i>] </i>I will be acting as Presider with the status of representator provided to me by the Belthean Government and acting with military jurisdiction. This case is considered a case under military review and consideration for determining court and structure. The case of Bonnie Axelrod v The Universal Magical Academy at Dial has the designation 47. This is a case of criminal action. The charges are as follows and are being treated with prejudice:</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:20<i>] </i>813 counts of professional negligence. 11 counts of misappropriation of resources from the Belthean Government 16 counts of fraudulent reporting Treason against your nation 750 counts of homicide 4 counts of failed reporting under military review 1,086 counts of failure to report waste to Infernal Affairs while under Universal Magical Academy at Dial Assignment 2 counts of poor practice 750 counts of homicide due to negligence</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:21<i>] </i>At this time there has never been such a disregard for resources within the Universal Magical Academy at Dial or the Belthean Government on record and not within slander laws.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:23<i>] </i>The defense is accused of these numerous charges due to their reported actions actions on EXT-111. They are currently a Field Researcher and Senior Lecturer at the Universal Magical Academy at Dial reporting from Dial Campus.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:24<i>] </i>At this time we will see both the defense and prosecution. Bonnie Axelrod has been charged and in prosecution James Tischler will represent the Universal Magical Academy at Dial.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:25<i>] </i>Bonnie Axelrod, considering these charges against you, what determination will you be seeking?</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:26<i>] </i>For the record Bonnie Axelrod will plead Not Guilty and not attempt to prove innocence. We will also proceed without restated charges due to the nature of communication through these tools.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:27<i>] </i>At this time we will allow the Defense their opening statement. (Bearbeitet)</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:27<i>] </i>Have you concluded your statement Defense?</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:28<i>] </i>We will now hear the statement of the Prosecution. (Bearbeitet)</p>
  <p><i>[</i>22:30<i>] </i>Evidence may now be submitted by the Prosecution.</p>

<h3>Maya Palme</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. I observed Bonnie Axelrod’s presence very frequently within the experiment labs. I never spoke with her personally, but she seemed to be issuing orders and assuming a position of authority, which I thought was strange for a new researcher. Still, she was definitely in charge of setting up the experimental labs, and I know I saw her in the labs more than once looking over data. I believe this mismanagement of resources was ordered and orchestrated by Bonnie. - Maya Palme</p>

<h3>Lorenz Engelberg</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;2. Campsite 3, under my management, received direct orders from Bonnie to assist in the construction of the experiment sites. These orders contained descriptions of the purpose and methodology of the experiments, with many detailed specifications of the needed laboratory facilities. Due to the nature of my position, I did not think to question these orders and had assumed they must have been approved as an acceptable allotment of resources. It appears Bonnie did not obtain this approval, and should be held responsible for the consequences of the experiments she authorized and directed. - Lorenz Engelberg</p>

<h3>Harry Riesz</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. I was watching when our camp leader received a new research order and the person who gave it to him definitely wasn’t Bonnie. They were taller and their hair looked quite different. It was dark, but I’d seen Bonnie around a lot and that person can’t have been her. Plus, she was way too young of a researcher to be allowed to create experiments. I’m sure you have her confused with somebody else. - Harry Riesz (edited)&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I will be representing Bonnie as an expert witness.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>23:02<i>] </i>My name is Head of Cultural Studies Bruno Gelehrte and while I may not have been present for the events of EXT-111 I do know Bonnie and her research as I’m familiar with all senior personnel’s work.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>23:08<i>] </i>Bonnie has an innocent disposition about her for the simple reason of her personality does not allow her anything else. According to reports she excels as a senior lecturer but is tragically terrible at field work due to several observed issues in behavior. She is a wonderful student of cultural studies but as stated, she is an Economist not someone who has the capacity to practically research the social minutiae that would have to be recorded and not simply concluded for the experiment to be at all valuable. I speak on Bonnie’s incompetence only in these areas however, the very areas necessary for her to successfully understand and work at these experiments. I will also state that no evidence has been provided that with certainty it was Bonnie only that her name appears on the reports. There are experts within culture who are experts in micro communities and study language as well as hand writing. I believe an internal investigation should continue if we cannot verifiably conclude this was Bonnie.</p>
  <p><i>[</i>23:10<i>] </i>As an expert on various subjects within Cultural Studies I can rest with the final statement that Bonnie simply didn’t have the capacity.</p>
