<blockquote>
  <p>“The Great Eight came before written or oral history, in fact they came before all other things.&nbsp; They were all that there originally was.” - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the beginning there were the great eight.&nbsp; All domains that were, were them and they were all things. After the beginning came a period of stagnation but also creation, domains remained static.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choosing a God</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All Gods are to be venerated, but the need for a principal deity is necessary.<ul>
      <li>you will subscribe to judgement [in death] by the laws of one.<ul>
          <li>People who worship too many Gods cannot be judged properly and sent to the Abyss</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is the duty of mortals to spread the domains of their chosen god.</li>
  <li>Children are often raised to worship the god of their family but often discover new faith with growth</li>
  <li>Sometimes, an apprentice under the master of a trade, new faith is found and options explored after the age of reason.</li>
  <li>Some Nations do not permit the practice of worship of certain deities under certain denominations. Others may be regionally frowned upon.<ul>
      <li>Free practice of faith exists in Belthas, but there are limitations for the safety of the people.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Practice of faith by differ by geographic location, culture, and denomination</li>
</ul>
<h2>Perpetuity</h2>
<p><i>the state or quality of lasting forever</i></p>
<p>Upon judgement, you are sent to a number of possible perpetuities based on how well you served your god and furthered their domains/lived in accordance with the tenets of the church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some places are used by many gods to send their faithful to all be together and dwell amongst certain gods in perpetuity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared Paradise</li>
</ul>
<p>Some places are very individualized and only followers of that faith are permitted to dwell within it</p>
<ul>
  <li>Au'pak's Great Conflict</li>
  <li>Doublelock's Heaven</li>
</ul>
<p>Those judged not to have lived a life in accordance with their principle deity and faith are sent to be punished for the sins they have committed against their faith and fellows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infernal Consequence</li>
</ul>
<h2>General&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>A Gods form</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some find it appropriate to not give physical descriptions<ul>
      <li>may be incomprehensible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some Temples show visages of Gods with symbolism or before the God's ascension</li>
  <li>Some Gods have distinct descriptions in their Holy Texts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Holy Texts</h2>
<h3>Nine Days to Anise</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From The Scoundrel sect of the faith of Frik, but quite popular to scholars all over.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nine Days to Anise is about a tax collector traveling south towards Anise after enjoying a wedding celebrating in the town of Cider. As he's leaving, he meets another traveler and they resume the journey together. As they make their way south, among conversation the traveler offers a new lesson to the taxman.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Anise, the traveler gives the Tenth Lesson, the taxman pausing to consider it. When looks up, the traveler is gone and so is any proof of him being there at all. The taxman runs into town to tell people what happened, a scribe writing the lessons and creating Nine Days to Anise.</p>
<p><strong><u>First Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Second Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Third Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Fourth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><i>“I once met a man in a temple</i><br><i>Who said the answer to salvation is simple</i><br><i>Put some coin in the till</i><br><i>Say a prayer, if you will</i><br><i>For peace of the soul is a rental”</i></p>
<p><strong><u>Fifth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Sixth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><i>“There once was a king on a throne</i><br><i>Who said "For as far as I see, I shall own!"</i><br><i>But then much to his surprise</i><br><i>Traitors gouged out his eyes</i><br><i>Now he rules in a cell, all alone”</i></p>
<p><strong><u>Seventh Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Eighth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Ninth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Tenth Lesson</u></strong></p>
<p><i>“For nine days we've traveled</i><br><i>For nine days we've strode</i><br><i>Nine answers I’ve given</i><br><i>To nine questions you’ve posed</i></p>
<p><i>From the price of salvation</i><br><i>To the joys of charity</i><br><i>You've sought out my wisdom</i><br><i>And I have humored thee</i></p>
<p><i>Yet you are none the wiser</i><br><i>Have gained no insight</i><br><i>You’ve closed shut your eyes</i><br><i>'Gainst a revealing light</i></p>
<p><i>You are not the first</i><br><i>And shall not be the last</i><br><i>Each man makes his own fate</i><br><i>His own knuckles he casts</i></p>
<p><i>I gave each of you freedom</i><br><i>I taught each of you Truth</i><br><i>To throw off your shackles</i><br><i>Your own purpose to sooth</i></p>
<p><i>Such was my first gift&nbsp;</i><br><i>And so it still stands</i><br><i>To break the Old Rote [Roht?]</i><br><i>Free from Gods' commands</i></p>
<p><i>Then you all found new bonds</i><br><i>Some to wealth, some to kings</i><br><i>Some to the pursuit of Reason</i><br><i>Measure, and Order of things</i></p>
<p><i>If such be your pleasure</i><br><i>Then let it bring you glee</i><br><i>As you serve yourselves more</i><br><i>Then the more you serve me</i></p>
<p><i>So go break the old Temples!</i><br><i>Then two monuments build</i><br><i>Call them "Ego" and "Id"</i><br><i>And do all that you Will</i></p>
<p><i>Embrace the new age</i><br><i>Your time of slavery is passed</i><br><i>Kill the God and his whip</i><br><i>Kill the Priest and his caste</i></p>
<p><i>It matters not what is done</i><br><i>What matters most is to live</i><br><i>That you could know the word "I"</i><br><i>Is the greatest gift "I" could give</i></p>
<p><i>Though the wheel of time turn</i><br><i>And kingdoms rise to fall</i><br><i>Know my love shall endure</i><br><i>And I remain with you all</i></p>
<p><i>There is point, there is purpose</i><br><i>To each laugh and each tear</i><br><i>What you consider mundanity&nbsp;</i><br><i>Is the universe, revealed”</i></p>
