  <p>“The Great Eight came before written or oral history, in fact they came before all other things.&nbsp; They were all that there originally was.” - Blaise</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the beginning there were the great eight.&nbsp; All domains that were, were them and they were all things. After the beginning came a period of stagnation but also creation, domains remained static.</li>
</ul>
