<blockquote>
  <p>“The Great Eight came before written or oral history, in fact they came before all other things.&nbsp; They were all that there originally was.” - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the beginning there were the great eight.&nbsp; All domains that were, were them and they were all things. After the beginning came a period of stagnation but also creation, domains remained static.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choosing a God</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All Gods are to be venerated, but the need for a principal deity is necessary.<ul>
      <li>you will subscribe to judgement [in death] by the laws of one.<ul>
          <li>People who worship too many Gods cannot be judged properly and sent to the Abyss</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Perpetuity</h2>
<p><i>the state or quality of lasting forever.</i></p>
<p>Upon judgement, you are sent to a number of possible perpetuities based on how well you served your god and furthered their domains/lived in accordance with the tenets of the church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some places are used by many gods to send their faithful to all be together and dwell amongst certain gods in perpetuity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shared Paradise</li>
</ul>
<p>Some places are very individualized and only followers of that faith are permitted to dwell within it</p>
<ul>
  <li>Au'pak's Great Conflict</li>
  <li>Doublelock's Heaven</li>
</ul>
<p>Those judged not to have lived a life in accordance with their principle deity and faith are sent to be punished for the sins they have committed against their faith and fellows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infernal Consequence</li>
</ul>
