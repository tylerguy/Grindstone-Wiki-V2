<h2>The Beginning</h2>

      <li>you will subscribe to judgement [in death] by the laws of one.<ul>
          <li>People who worship too many Gods cannot be judged properly and sent to the Abyss</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>It is the duty of mortals to spread the domains of their chosen god.</li>

<p>Those judged not to have lived a life in accordance with their principle deity and faith are sent to be punished for the sins they have committed against their faith and fellows.</p>
