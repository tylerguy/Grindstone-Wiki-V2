<blockquote>
  <p>"Aetherial Studies is a research department dedicated to the study of movement of aether that exists as the matrix for which all planes exist within. They also study spellcraft and the theory behind it including its three component parts being aeonization, summation, and programming." - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aetherial Studies is a general term used for the study of both theory and practice of efferent and innate casting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>has a large amount of overlap with other studies such as Planar Studies and its need to understand the Belthidian laws.</li>
  <li>Aetherial Studies, like engineering, is more concerned with the local physical laws for practical casting and only references the Belthidian laws to create educated guesses as to the interactions of other planes when they are necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Spells</h1>
<p>Spells are classified by “degree”, and only classified according to the minimum aether and rate needed to cast. Those that require a lot of aether, or a lot to be programmed fast are considered difficult and dangerous.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spells that are specific and named exist, but there is a lot of flexibility and infinite ways to use aether through casting.</li>
  <li>enhancing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delay Mechanism&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>causes an object to freeze in space that is very small for a short amount of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Magpie’s Magical Motivator</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Throws shit at you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Water Walk</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Make water like glass, but only for you”<ul>
      <li>Too dangerous; nobody uses it.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Casting</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>“you don't need to know how the cake bakes to make a damn good one.&nbsp; With that said we are really interested in all the little things that had to happen to make that cake so sweet in my department.&nbsp; Not actual cake, but casting of course.” - Elham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire process does require a start and end determined by the spell lines; nearly every spell used these days has the same initializing sequence and same termination sequence. Everything in between is programming to get the desired goal.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The beginning of the process requires the initial spell line. This requires very little aether and is one of the first things taught when becoming a caster.<ul>
      <li>The small charge of aether moves from the four-point to the aeonized object and is directed to the weak area to create an opening, a process called Aeonization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Next is Summation<ul>
      <li>requires concentrated beams of extremely small radii to move through long distances within the aetherial matrix then suddenly stop and combine into a small charge. This creates ripples in the aetherial matrix, similar to dropping several small stones in a pond. The size of combined ripples, direction, rate and size of the hole are all variables for the movement of aether, though Summation allows one to control the direction of the aether flow and move it towards the hole made by the initial spell line.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>Four-point</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Four-Point is a book that has four corners covered in an ornate blue metal that easily holds and releases the aether, acting as a superconductor.<ul>
      <li>These corners store a good amount of aether for specific use and their positionality and superconductor nature creates what we call the "weak area”, or a thin point between the plane you are on and the aetherial matrix.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, a caster can have an additional four corner set-up on the opposite cover though Double-sided Four Points are not common. Typically, only if one has a lot of notes and spells within their four-point or are a common ritual caster.<ul>
          <li>Rituals are an advanced form of casting and not usual.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inside cover contains the <u>Aetherius Simplicator,</u> a “cheat sheet”, and pages are set up a little differently than a typical journal as the side margins are much bigger and visible lines go top to bottom separating them. Between the margins is where the spells are written with “spell-ink”; typical ink with diamond dust mixed in.&nbsp; Many four-points have alternating parchment and then wax parchment for those who like to put their components on their book when they cast.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The latter third of the Four-Point are without lines and where most put ritual instructions, illustrations, and other various notes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aeonized Object</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Almost anything can be an Aeonized object</li>
  <li>can be created but may also occur spontaneously</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve found, so far, stones, a pane of glass, a bird feather, a wagon wheel, three different small trees, and an anvil.&nbsp; They are very rare but I am an Aeonization specialist so I have particular skills, which are need to know currently, that make it far easier.” - <strong>Researcher Wooton on naturally occurring aeonized objects</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Synthesis magic hopes to eventually make components obsolete, though it’s currently too complicated and impractical. Combined with aether, components do a lot of heavy lifting during casting.</li>
  <li>“For instance, it's easier to spark oil to be set aflame than to create fire in space, although people like me can do that.&nbsp; In that case, oil is a component.&nbsp; Don't put oil on your book though, tip from me.”</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rituals</h1>
<ul>
  <li>an advanced form of casting requiring multiple participants in an odd arrangement and incorporating a designated foci.</li>
  <li>Foci - a person who is doing the most during a ritual. also going to be the place where things go wrong if the ritual is interrupted or someone makes a big enough mistake.<ul>
      <li>Elham is frequently a foci.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>“I can give you the general description.&nbsp; Ritual circles involve, or should involve, an odd number of casters working in tandem to create a spell or effect.&nbsp; The more casters, the more powerful.&nbsp; The maximum is 13. Ritual circles must be very specific and the minutia of it is literally life and death.”</i></li>
  <li>Military Research is interested in the usage of Rituals</li>
</ul>
<h1>Casting Types</h1>
<h2>Aetherial</h2>
<h3><strong>Efferent</strong></h3>
<p>Casters require a four-point or aeonized object and nearly all material provided at UMAD on spell casting has been in regards to efferent casting.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Primal</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Primal refers to all efferent casting prior to common utilization of aeonized objects. The date of origin is uncertain, but is often believed to have come from observing the actions of the innate casters, natural curiosity and the desire to replicate. Their magic is often identified as “messy” and seems to be the casting of attempting various options before finding something that works.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does one cast without an aeonized object or four point?<ul>
      <li>Many scholars believe that the aetherial matrix behaved much differently centuries ago, others believe that the planar "landscape" might have differed or the makeup of the world itself affected the ability to cast aether could more easily come in contact with the material as the need for objects was not necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Without objects as we think of them, there were and are ways to aeonize and begin the three step process of casting.<ul>
      <li>Historical Evidence<ul>
          <li>One very dangerous way was to come in contact with aether directly in small amounts prior to casting or regularly. This is not advised and leads to several physiological concerns.<ul>
              <li>physiological concerns include burns, illness and death.<ul>
                  <li>Capita Magna means “big head”, evidence supports long term exposure caused swelling of the cranium during developmental years.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>"One example of this are the Capita Magna which were primal casters from what is present Mezzomond. These people would have innates cause aetherial exhaust so that they could "burn into themselves the magic". Capita Magna were spiritual advisors and primal casters until the practice eventually died out during an Azalt invasion of the the region." - Blaise</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Earliest Azalt casters&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Before the utilization of objects, they would create large geographic areas with aeonized materials, essentially creating giant 4-points they would live on.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since there is no certainty to the rate and amount of aether, Primal casting often caused large aetherial exhaust or backlash.<ul>
      <li>For this reason, many early Azalt casters would also carry and sometimes stitch into themselves lead. The constant contact and inadvertent consumption also had physiological effects.<ul>
          <li>It would take until Classical Casting to return to the utilization of aeonized metals and an object held in hand to cast though they would be much smaller and programming utilized much more efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arcane Magic</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>refers to all casting prior to the current era of casting, back to these particular casters.</li>
  <li>Arcane and Primal are often used interchangeably by those who are not familiar with the history and development of efferent casting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Designated efferent casters would learn about the trade from an early age and wear metal rings of aeonized material. The rings were not utilized as objects but instead were used to open the material to the aetherial matrix, usually without summation.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating holes much larger than utilized today</li>
  <li>Depending on the rate of waves summating to the opening, this would create a large variety of instances upon casting.<ul>
      <li>Means that aether will flow in either slowly or rapidly to the area, and due to limitations in measuring the rate and amount of aether provided, programming was greatly limited as a concept and process</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Discovery</h4>
<h4>Classical</h4>
<h4>New Mastery</h4>
<h3><strong>Innate</strong></h3>
<p>These casters are someone with a clear connection to aether and cast without aeonized objects or a four-point. Generally, innate casters don't require the advanced understanding of Aetherial Studies but in some cases, it's utilized to advance their summation abilities. Their magic can be considered unrefined but intuitive.</p>
<p>From notes UMAD has collected and by Obelus, it is inferred that many innate casters will “summate” by means of rapid, short distance summation and is highly impractical for efferent casting. The rapid, short range castings can cause greater interference to aetherial casting when large numbers of innate casters begin summation near each other, unlike efferent casters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many, but not all innate casters seem to constantly summate a small amount but do not actively aeonize.</li>
  <li><u>Learned</u> (educated) innate casters have found ways to mimic efferent spells in very limited ways.</li>
  <li>Innate casters themselves act as both the object and the four-point.</li>
  <li>Some are familial but others seem almost random.<ul>
      <li>There has been much study as to what makes an innate caster.</li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>Various categories<ul>
      <li>no evidence to their occurrence on EXT-918</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Sianal</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Generally recognized as follows of Belthid, but organized differently.</li>
  <li>There is some assistance from an external force and much of their casting is similar to <strong>Discovery Efferent</strong>. Yet, the means of casting differ as they do not utilize a four-point in the way we understand them.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Divine Casting</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By the Cloth</strong></p>
<p><i>“through the actions of a god”</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Study has been conducted on divine casting with results albeit little.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unspecified Grace</strong></p>
<p><i>“without the knowledge of what god might be acting through them if any”</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is confirmed as not innate aetherial as there is no immediate proof to the utilization of the three steps of casting.</li>
  <li>does not seem to have aeonization, summation, and programming.</li>
  <li>By observation "something" is altered in material space. &nbsp;The something is the fuel and the alteration the equivalent to programming.</li>
  <li>The intention is not of the caster but by an exterior agent, the god.</li>
  <li>It is known that divine casting typically requires the caster to willingly intend the casting. &nbsp;This is still not well understood.</li>

<h1>Breakthroughs</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Necromancy was a big breakthrough in programming.<ul>
      <li>The realization we could make constructs more efficiently</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Newest study is Synthesis</li>
  <li>Manipulation of overlays is a recent development.&nbsp; We use a concept called Aetherial Exhausting.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Glossary</h1>
<ul>
  <li><u>Overlays</u> - what happens when 5 dimensionally one plane overlaps the other, happens all the time in short and instantaneous moments but sometimes it lasts longer<ul>
      <li>point of an overlay is to limit space between planes to create ease of movement or to safely study the natural laws of a plane from a native plane.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><u>Aetherial Exhausting</u> - [when you use it] you summate a lot of aether into a safe place within the plane.<ul>
      <li>causes a distortion in the aetherial matrix and the space is filled by an adjacent plane.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“<u>By Obelus</u>” - the research and results conducted in the city of Obelus. Not an academy like UMAD, and called “Rogue Tutors Guild”. Though helpful to studies, their ways of conducting research are often frowned upon and controversial.</li>
